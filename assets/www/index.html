  <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
  
  
  
  <p>Buying or selling a housecan be just as perplexing as  deciding
which hand to keep or discard at a casino. But it doesn’t have to be. If you make the right
decisions early on, put a great team in place, and follow the instructions I give you in this
app, you will feel like a pro playing among the card sharks in no time!
To win at anything, you have to fully understand the game, or at the very least, have a team that
does. In real estate, the game is not just about choosing the right home. It comes down to strategy,
assessment, planning, organization, and skill. If that sounds like a heavy load, don’t worry, you don’t
have to go it alone. The weight can be carried by finding the right professionals to help you through
the homebuying process. Having experts guide you will garner better results than trying to do it all
yourself. For starters, utilizing experienced real estate professionals will save you time and money,
and will help you avoid unnecessary hassles.</p>
<p>For those of you who yearn to understand the perceived “mysteries” behind successful real estate
deals, you’ve come to the right place. I happen to be just the person who will be able to demystify the
real estate buying and selling process, ultimately making it much simpler for you to understand. I will
teach you how to pick the winners instead of the losers. Well, maybe not in a game of spades, bridge,
or UNO, but certainly in regard to real estate.</p>
<p>Here’s a little about me before you begin reading: I am a realtor licensed in two states—and have
been an agent since 2003. My business partner and I have sold over $50 million in properties. I
personally enjoy working with first-time homebuyers, and you can watch me doing just that on my
highly rated HGTV show Property Virgins. It brings me personal joy to help families achieve the
American Dream of homeownership.</p>
<p>When I was twenty-four years old, I purchased my first property. It was overwhelming, confusing,
and exciting all at the same time. Ask any millionaire, and he or she will tell you that the foundation
of wealth is real estate. I knew that I was making the right decision by purchasing versus renting, but
the nuances and paperwork made my head spin. My uncle had been a real estate broker for over thirty
years, so I had more knowledge than the average “Property Virgin.” Still, I was intimidated just by the
thought of what I imagined the process entailed.</p>
<p>Don’t laugh, but the moment I got the keys to my first property, I cried like a baby. In that minute, I
realized I owned a piece of the earth. Land is one thing we can never make more of. It is what it is on
this earth, and I actually owned my own little piece of it. It was such an exhilarating feeling, and I
was hooked. By the time I was thirty, I had flipped more than a dozen investment properties, earning a
hefty profit. As time went on and market conditions changed, I decided that buying and holding mademore long-term sense for me. There is no doubt in my mind that owning real estate can help you build
substantial wealth—if it’s done correctly.</p>
<p>Like starting a new relationship, many people go about their real estate ventures the wrong way.
They fall in love with the exterior, but underneath the cosmetic enhancements and curb appeal can lie
structural  defects  that  may  alter  the  building’s  integrity.  Often  there  might  be  material  defects
connected to the home that you don’t learn about until after you’ve signed on the dotted line and are
stuck with a thirty-year mortgage. Sound familiar? I pray not! My hope is that I have caught your
interest in time, before you embark upon the joys of homeownership and so you don’t make costly
mistakes. Knowledge not only gives you power, but it also gives you the extra edge to make smarter
decisions regarding the purchase of a new home. After all, you’re going to live in it for a while, so
you’d better like it!</p>
<p>Along the way on your quest toward homeownership, you may make mistakes. Keep calm . . . it’s
okay! This app will help Property Virgins, but it will also help those who may be recovering from a
bad experience in buying or selling a home, and who simply want to make better decisions going
forward.</p>
<p>Take for example, first-time buyer Natasha, a pharmaceutical sales rep from Boston. She received
a job promotion that required her to relocate to Florida in a hurry. After scouting several homes
online, this impatient cash-buyer eventually found one that suited all of her needs. But before dipping
her feet in the water to purchase it, Natasha asked a friend to preview the home in person on her
behalf.</p>
<p>After  Natasha  finally got into her  new  home  and started unpacking, she  awoke  several  times
throughout the night to the loudest noise she had ever heard. It sounded like a freight train coming
through the house. As it turned out, there were train tracks just a few hundred yards away from her
home. Three or four times per hour, a l-o-o-o-n-n-g-g-g cargo train went by and shook the whole
house! Her friend had no way of knowing this when he viewed the property. He was inexperienced
and didn’t necessarily know the right questions to ask or the red flags to look out for. Not to mention,
the real estate agent showing the property was a “listing agent,” or “seller’s agent.” That meant that
the  agent’s  primary  responsibility  was  to  the  seller,  not  the  buyer!  Although  the  agent  was  not
dishonest—she did mention on the phone that there was a train nearby that ran only “a couple of times
a day.” In actuality, she did not know much about the train schedule and had just made a wild guess.</p>
<p>In hindsight, Natasha should have hired a real estate “buyer’s agent” familiar with the area to
work on her behalf. That agent may have pointed out details that the seller’s agent left out.</p>
<p>Natasha also should have hired a specialized real estate attorney who was familiar with Florida
laws to carefully review her contract and closing documents. Instead, the Boston-based buyer trusted
the  “friend,”  who  was  not  familiar  with  the  laws  in  Florida,  where  she  was  purchasing.  The
paperwork wound up being a headache, and the whole homebuying experience was a giant fiasco.</p>
<p>Fast forward nine months. Natasha was astounded to discover the home she just paid cash for was
plagued by a “dirty title” that was riddled with blemishes and liens against the property. The sum of
these mishaps caused her great distress and anxiety, ultimately leading Natasha to regret her decision
to buy the home. Certainly, any costly setback can ruin the joys of owning a home very quickly!</p>
<p>Everything becomes simpler when you understand it, because education is the key to success in
anything we do. Purchasing real estate is no different than learning anything else new for the first-
time. You may be a homebuying newbie, such as a young couple or a single person who is simplytired of paying rent. Perhaps you’ve been renting and now want a place of your own so you can
provide stability and comfort for your family. Maybe you are someone who is skeptical about buying
another home due to a past negative experience. Whatever your circumstance, keep calm, because
now you have me to be your personal real estate guide.</p>
<p>After you read the content of this app, I recommend that you keep it within arm’s reach, perhaps stowed in a
handy compartment of your vehicle. Then you will always have me with you if you need a quick
reference or reminder as you go through the homebuying process. Within the pages of Keep Calm . . .
It’s Just Real Estate, you will find no-holds-barred, real answers.</p>
<p>As a real  estate agent, owner, and investor, I have ridden the emotional  roller coaster of the
housing industry and fared just fine. I have soared to the heights of success, and I have counted my
beans when the market hit bottom. I persisted, and I made it because real estate is my passion. I truly
enjoy helping people find the home of their dreams, but even more so, I find serenity in knowing that I
can  provide  my  clients  with  guidance  and  answers  in  an  industry  that  can  be  confusing  and
complicated to those who are not familiar with how the process works.</p>
<p>So with that said, if you are ready to learn how to swim in the real estate shark tank, dive in! I’ll
catch you (or at least swim beside you). And if you commit to following the guidelines that I offer in
this app, and keep in mind the prescriptive “Chill Pills” I note in each chapter, then you will surely
backstroke through the homebuying process in no time!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 1<br/>
BUYING A HOME WITH CONFIDENCE:<br/>
Ready to Take the Plunge?</h2>



<p>If the thought of bitting into your own piece of the real estate pie makes
you  feel  anxious  or  nervous,  fear  not!  This  is  perfectly  normal.  After  all,  this  definitely
qualifies  as  a  “major  life  decision,”  and  will  go  down in your  personal  history book of
awesome accomplishments one day.</p>
<p>Once you decide to buy, go forward with confidence and let the goodness flow to you. The way to
do this begins by choosing the right guidance and support team, trusting your instincts, using all the
common sense you can muster up, and focusing on the most important aspects of what you want in a
home. For example, you may have to sacrifice a few vanity items in order to gain something else that
could pay off handsomely in the long run. You may even have to let go of some personal or emotional
attachments to be able to live in a certain location, or let go of your preferred style of home to buy
something within your means. In other words, the first lesson in homebuying is this: <strong>Be flexible!</strong></p>
<p>I emphasize flexibility because I’ve had numerous clients who fall head over heels in love with a
house, but hesitate because their dresser wouldn’t fit in the bedroom. Or, they don’t have a table long
enough for the massive dining room in the new house. Furniture will always be replaceable. It is
much more difficult to find the perfect house versus the perfect sofa. Don’t be so rigid that you miss
an opportunity, but by the same token, don’t settle for a home that you have to work really hard to
convince yourself you like.</p>
<p>There  is  a  difference  between focusing on what really matters  versus  letting your  head  turn
toward cosmetic qualities. For example, I once had a realtor friend who showed a couple at least ten
homes and condominiums before they settled on one they liked. Finally, they signed the paperwork for
a gorgeous townhome. After living there for only a month or so, everything started falling apart!
Shoddy materials were used when the contractors built the townhomes, so although the home was
only a couple of years old, there were minor things that constantly cost them money and time to repair.
It was a “money pit” with unexpected pitfalls. Closet doors mysteriously fell off the hinges with very
little encouragement; the toilet latch no longer flushed properly, there were small cracks in the wall
where the foundation had settled; and the windows never shut properly. Needless to say, the heat and
their money flew right out the window. These constant hassles made the place not-so-appealing after
just a few weeks.</p>

<div class="flex-rectangle">
<H2>CHILL PILL #1</H2>
<p>When shopping for a house, pay attention to fundamental aspects like location and size, but
don’t ignore the craftsmanship. Little repairs can add up to one big problem, and the house may
turn out to be more than you bargained for!</p>
</div>
<p>Structural  details  are  the  most vital  and  lasting aspects  of a  home.  Be  careful  not to  get so
enamored by the way a place looks on the surface that you overlook the most important factors. As
they say, “Looks fade!” and this holds true with real estate.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 2<br/>
BUILDING YOUR REAL ESTATE DREAM
TEAM:<br/>
The First Step</h2>

<p>Great,  you passed chapter 1!  I gess that means you’re ready for the
nitty gritty. Let’s talk about building your team. The quarterback and MVP of your real
estate dream team will be your agent. A qualified and experienced agent will easily be
able to advise you on the other members you will need to add to your roster, such as the
inspector and attorney. We’ll cover those key positions in later chapters.</p>
<p>Having been a real estate agent for over a dozen years, I have consistently done my very best for
all of my clients. But I didn’t learn to be a fantastic agent on my own. Hats off to the many stellar
agents I have met and worked with over the years! A few of them helped me perfect my craft and
grow my business by teaching me the most valuable qualities of a good agent. If your agent does not
possess the following traits, then you should consider seeking the services of another. If you are
planning on buying or selling a home soon, this advice can save you a lot of time, grief, and money.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER 3<br/>
DON’T WORRY, BUY HAPPY!
<br/>
Finding the Home of Your Dreams</h2>

  
  
  <p>Finally, you're ready to start lokking. this will  probably  be  your
favorite part of the homebuying process. Getting into a house and walking the floor plan,
backyard, and neighborhood is not only fun, but it can also help you make the best decision
on which home feels like the best fit for your family’s needs.</p>
<p>After seeing a handful of homes, you may find that you are overwhelmed by the details. It’s very
common to see three or four homes and by the next day have a hard time remembering which house
was which. Did house number two have the landscaped backyard or did house number three? Did
house number one have the oak cabinetry? Or was it the second house? Trust me: I’ve seen it happen
time and time again.
To avoid confusion, here are a few quick tips to aid you in an organized and progressive search:</p>
<p><strong>Never see more than five homes in a day</strong>. You will be mentally exhausted trying to
remember the details of each. Additionally, you should take your time in each home to fully
examine what it has to offer.</p>
<p><strong>Keep a log</strong>. I always recommend keeping track of the homes you’ve seen in a small notebook.
Take notes about your likes and dislikes. Or put together a spreadsheet where you can
compare each home’s features and amenities. Some items to note would be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Does the home layout work for your family’s needs?</li>
  <li>Size of kitchen</li>
  <li> Number of bedrooms and bathrooms and their dimensions</li>
  <li> Square footage of the house</li>
  <li> Storage space, including closets and cupboards</li>
  <li> Does it include a basement (finished or unfinished)? Does it include a garage?</li>
  <li> Landscaping condition</li>
  <li> Size of yard and/or privacy of backyard</li>
  <li> Paint condition, including ceiling spackle• Chips or cracks in flooring or tile</li>
  <li> Are the windows and doors sound? How new are they?</li>
  <li> Is the foundation sound? Are the walls free of cracks and visible repairs?</li>
  <li> When was the last time the roof tiles or shingles were replaced?</li>
  <li> How new are the appliances? Were records kept?</li>
  <li> How new is the heating or AC unit? Does the home have ceiling fans?</li>
  <li> Is it well insulated and ventilated?</li>
  <li> How old are the electrical wires?</li>
  <li> Is it close to any major disturbances—train tracks, highways, schools, etc.?</li>
  <li> Is the neighborhood safe?</li>
  <li> What type of conveniences are nearby—stores, shopping plazas, restaurants, post office, banks, etc.?</li>
  <li> Age of home</li>
  <li> History of property ownership</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Take photos</strong>. Normally, your agent will send you an MLS listing of the property. But in case
the listing doesn’t include a substantial number of photos, take a camera or a camera phone
with you.</p>
<p><strong>Narrow down your top three</strong>. After seeing a handful of homes, start narrowing down your
prospects. Revisit all of your top picks. At second glance you may notice something you
didn’t see the first-time around.</p>
<p><strong>Visit your prospective home at different times of day</strong>. Homes may appear different during
the day than they do at night. It is also wise to visit the home again right after a heavy rain if
you can manage it. Homeowners can mask water damage when the weather is dry. But chances
are, when it’s raining or has rained recently, the house will tell on itself. Go straight to the
basement and notice the smell. Does it smell or feel damp? If so, water may be getting in.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER 4<br/>
DISTRESSED PROPERTIES:
<br/>
Are They Really Worth the Hunt?</h2>

  

<p>As a general piece of advice, I would say that you should stick to finding
a home the traditional way if this is your first-time. You’re likely to have a more pleasant
experience than going the route of purchasing a distressed property. However, this doesn’t
mean that if a good short sale or foreclosure opportunity comes your way, you shouldn’t
attempt to pursue it. I just want to make sure you are informed about the extra complications you may
have to handle.</p>
<p>In case you are wondering what it means for a property to be distressed, let’s explore this bit of
real estate lingo. A “distressed” property refers to a house that must be sold because of the previous
owner’s inability to pay their mortgage. Depending on how cooperative the owner is, sometimes the
bank tries to work things out with them, but if negotiations fail, it leaves only a few possibilities.  </p>
<div data-role="collapsible-set">
  <div data-role="collapsible">
    <h3> Short Sale</h3>
    <p>This is a sale in which the proceeds from selling the property will fall short of
what is still owed on the property. This includes liens against the property—that is, legal claims
that must be paid before the property is sold. In a short sale, the lien holders agree to let the lien
go and accept less than the amount owed, so the house might be listed for much less than it is
worth. This is better than foreclosure, because it results in fewer fees and costs, but in both
foreclosures and short sales, the homeowner ends up with a negative credit report.</p>
  </div>
  <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
    <h3>Foreclosure</h3>
    <p>Simply put, foreclosure is the process by which a homeowner’s right to a
property is forfeited because of failure to pay the mortgage. If the owner cannot pay off the
outstanding debt or sell it via short sale, the property then goes to a foreclosure auction where
potential buyers can bid on the property.</p>
  </div>
  <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
    <h3>REO Property or Real Estate Owned:</h3>
    <p> When the house still goes unpurchased either by an
investor or through a foreclosure auction, the bank will then list the house for sale with a seller’s
agent. At this point the bank is very motivated to sell the home!</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>With any distressed real estate property, be forewarned that there may be more complications thanwith a house that is being sold for other reasons. It is better not to get emotionally attached to any
property you find in foreclosure or at auction.
</p><p>A perfect  story that  comes  to  mind  is  of  clients  who  came  to  me  after  trying their  hand  at
foreclosure auctions. An adorable older couple, Josef and Hanna, originally came from Poland. They
were self-made, having successfully run a family business in the United States for almost twenty
years.</p>
<p>As Hanna explained, they had attended a few seminars on “real estate investing” and “tricks to
successfully buying foreclosures.” When they embarked on their new home search, Josef was adamant
that it had to be a foreclosure. And he was confident that he knew all there was to know about the
process after attending these seminars and reading a few books.</p>
<p>To make a long story short, by the time they threw in the towel and came to me, they’d been to
nineteen foreclosure auctions and lost out on all eleven homes they bid on.</p>
<p>What they had not anticipated was the amount of research and work they’d need to put into the
process to ensure they were making a sound investment. Week after week, Josef would go to the
courthouse and get the list of new foreclosures. After work, he and Hanna would drive around to all
of the homes on the list to view the exteriors. On a few occasions, they found themselves face-to-face
with  disgruntled  homeowners  who  were  irate  the  bank  was  foreclosing!  At  the  auctions,  they
nervously bid on properties without inspection or even getting a chance to see the interior, other than
a few old photos they found online.</p>
<p>The most defeating part of the process for Josef was that after all of his research and hard work,
and after taking valuable hours off from his business to attend the auctions, he’d walk away empty-
handed. Having been outbid by investors time and time again, and beat out by cash-on-site deals, he
decided it was no longer worth his time or trouble.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I found Hanna and Josef a terrific five-bedroom home in superb condition. The kicker
was that the sellers needed to sell quickly because they were relocating. So they accepted the offer
for $23,000 lower than what it appraised for. In the end, Josef declared, “We wasted our time for
months trying to score a foreclosure. My time alone was worth more than what I would have saved if
we had gotten one.”</p>

<div class="flex-rectangle"><h3>CHILL PILL #9</h3>
<p>Shopping exclusively for a foreclosure is not something I recommend. If things work out that
way, great! But don’t be narrow-sighted about it, because you could miss out on an opportunity
to buy an undervalued home in a great neighborhood. Motivated sellers can often run you an
even better deal than a distressed property.</p></div>

  <h2>CHAPTER 5<br/>
THE DOWN AND DIRTY ABOUT DOWN
PAYMENTS:
<br/>
Knowing What You Can Afford</h2>

  
  
  <p>it can be easy to get lost in The idea of buying your own house, especially
if this is your first-time. You may have private daydreams of coming home, throwing off your
coat, and sinking in with a good book in front of your elegant fireplace, or having the freedom
to decorate as you please. Homeownership can be a joyful experience, indeed.</p>
<p>However, before you get too lost in those daydreams, there is one minor detail you must have
thought of by now. That’s right: Money.</p>
<p>Ah, yes. It all boils down to financial matters, doesn’t it? So before you begin your quest to start
shopping for the house of your dreams, there is one very fundamental task that you must take care of
ahead of time.</p>
<p>Before you obtain a mortgage—or even a lender’s green light that you can be approved for one—
there is one very important thing you must have in hand, for the sake of both the lender and the seller.
You’ve got it. It’s the down payment!</p>
<p>Preapproval is essential, but having a down payment requires long-term planning. Those days of
100 percent financing no longer exist after the housing crash of 2007 to 2008, which still ripples
through the economy in today’s housing industry. Most banks feel that the homeowner should have a
vested interest in the home, making them less likely to default on the mortgage.</p>
<p>However,  you  may  want  to  look  into  the  programs  that  assist  first-time  homebuyers.  These
programs vary depending on the state you live in. Some are designed to help low-income or minority
families raise the money to put down for a home. Areas going through a rejuvenation often have HUD
homes available. This can be a great stepping stone for first-time homebuyers.</p>
<p>For  example,  in  Atlanta  there  is  a  program  called  the  Atlanta  Affordable  Homeownership
Program (AAHOP) as well as the Homeownership Assistance Program (HOAP). Both help buyers
who are in need of down payment assistance and closing costs. These are not suited for everyone, but
there are similar programs in other states that anyone considering purchasing property should look
into.</p>
<p>The  California  Housing  Finance  Agency  offers  the  Affordable  Housing  Partnership  Program(AHPP) and the California Homebuyer’s Down Payment Assistance Program (CHDAP) to qualifying
borrowers who are in need of a down payment and closing costs.</p>
<p>Who knows, maybe one of these programs is right for you and can give you the boost you need to
finally start shopping for a great new home for you and your family! I strongly encourage you to look
into programs offered by your state.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER 7<br/>
THE THRILL OF MAKING AN OFFER:<br/>
How to Seal the Deal</h2>

<p><strong>LET  ME  TELL YOU A LITTLE  SECRET.  COME  A LITTLE</strong> closer.  When I visit
houses with a client, I can tell very quickly whether or not the home is a good fit. They’ll
say things like:</p>
  
  <p><em>“Oh, honey . . . look at that tree in the backyard! It will be fun for you to install a swing or
build a treehouse for the kids there.”</em></p>

<p><em>“Our king-size mahogany bed will look so amazing in this master bedroom!”</em></p>

<p><em>“Let’s paint this room blue. My Navajo rug will look great in the middle of the room.”</em></p>
  
  <p>You see, when people truly love a house, they start to picture themselves living in it. They picture
their own belongings in the rooms, or they envision their family participating in activities on the
grounds. They can imagine where things go or how they’ll decorate to make it tailored to their own
preferences and styles. That is how I can tell when we have picked out a winner . . . a gem property!
And when that gem property comes at a price that is exactly within their budget or lower, even better!</p>
<p>When that silent, internal nudge to make an offer kicks in . . . act quickly! This is the point at
which your real estate agent should try not to dissuade you, but rather guide you through the next phase
of the homebuying process and help boost your confidence as you take this next big step toward
homeownership. It’s time to make an offer.</p>
<p>Once you have made the decision to make an offer, the next move is for your real estate agent to
call the listing agent who represents the home you’re interested in. Their role at this juncture is to ask
the right questions to gauge the situation. How motivated is the seller? Have there been any other
offers on the table? Based upon the feedback you receive via your buyer’s agent, you’ll be better
armed with facts necessary to create an offer strategy that will ultimately put you in the most desirable
position as a buyer for that particular home.<br/>
At this point, your bidding strategy options are two-fold:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Proceed to make a lower offer with the hopes that the seller will accept your bid or at the
very least counter you with a number that is not too far off from your initial offer.</p></li>

<li><p>Cut to the chase and offer the seller a price close to the asking price, if not at the full price.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Bear in mind that the deciding factor on which option you choose largely depends on the level of
supply versus the demand for that particular style of home in that condition in a given area during the
same time period. And of course the game changes if other offers have also been made.</p>
<p>Now you may gasp when reading this. You may be wondering, why in the world would Egypt
suggest I even consider paying full asking price for a home? Well, if you’ve watched me go through
the homebuying process on my show, Property Virgins, then you’re no stranger to the many “bidding
wars” I’ve had to wage on behalf of my clients. I’m proud to say I’ve won most of the bidding wars
I’ve participated in. However, there have been those instances when certain clients felt they knew
more  than I do  (despite  my being the  real  estate  expert),  and  they opted  to  “play hardball”  by
assuming they were the only buyers in the market.</p>
<p>Eventually, their dreams were shattered when they were outbid by another buyer who recognized
a good house when they saw it and acted accordingly.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER 8<br/>
GET OUT YOUR MAGNIFYING GLASS:
<br/>
Why You Should Never Overlook the Inspection</h2>

<p><strong>THERE  IS  ONE  MORE  “VIP”  WHO  WILL  BECOME  AN</strong> integral  part  of  your
professional guidance team. Who is it? Would you care for some clues?</p>
<p>Think of Sherlock Holmes with his magnifying glass. Or the beloved 1980s cartoon
character, Inspector Gadget, with all of his long limbs and useful tools. Still stumped?</p>
<p>It’s your home inspector! Hiring a home inspector will be one of the smartest things you’ve ever
done in your life. They have a knack for “getting to the bottom of things” by discovering problems that
others may have overlooked.</p>
<p>I love  a  bargain as  much as  the  next person,  but I learned  more  than a  decade  ago  when I
purchased my first investment property that getting a home inspection is one thing you must not cut
corners on. Even if it seems like yet another $400 to $800 tacked on to your already mounting tally of
closing  expenses,  this  is  a  relatively  modest  amount  of  money  to  spend  in  comparison  to  the
headaches and financial beatings you may face if the house ends up being a “lemon.” Have you ever
seen the comedy with Tom Hanks, The Money Pit? Unfortunately, this scenario happens all over the
United States every day, and the people who were once happy new homeowners are certainly not
laughing.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example of why I am so adamant about the home inspection. I once had a cash
buyer whom I will call Mr. Know-It-All. Maybe you know the type: the guy with deep pockets and an
expert  at  every  profession  under  the  sun,  from  carpentry,  waterproofing,  electrical  work,  and
plumbing to roofing and landscaping. You name it, and he proclaimed to be an “expert” at it.</p>
<p>For more than a year and a half, I worked to find a transitional home for this bachelor who was
moving out of a condo and into the residential lifestyle. He wanted a place with lots of personality in
a “hip” neighborhood, but at the same time he wanted it to be a good investment property to put his
money into for the long run. Without exaggeration, I believe I showed him close to fifty properties! I
worked hard for him in every way imaginable, and found one great deal after the next. However,
nothing was good enough for him. Just as we were both ready to throw in the towel on finding him the
perfect house to buy, Eureka . . . we struck gold!</p>
<p>Indeed, I found him a nearly 3,000-square-foot, four-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath single-family
home located on a quiet cul-de-sac in an up-and-coming neighborhood. The home was within walkingdistance to a top-rated elementary school, so I knew immediately that this house was a real gem and
offered incredible resale potential. Ultimately, that was what he wanted: a home he could live in and
then flip for a sizable profit in a few years.</p>
<p>Even though he liked it instantly, the work was not over. After showing it to him on six different
occasions (yes, you saw that right—six!), my client finally got to the stage in which he was willing to
write an offer on the property. Hallelujah. Can anyone say, “Happy Hour?!”</p>
<p>That Saturday, my client came to my real estate office, and as we sat and talked over a cup of
coffee, we reviewed all of the legal paperwork that is required to present an offer to purchase. I had
prepared a custom Comparative Market Analysis (CMA) for us to review and discuss.</p>

<div class="flex-rectangle"><h2>CHILL PILL #18</h2>
<p>Ask your real estate agent to give you a comparative market analysis (CMA) prior to
submitting an offer on any property. A CMA averages out the selling price of recently sold
homes in the area that are similar to yours. This is a valuable negotiating tool.</p></div>

<p>Why, you may ask? A thoroughly researched CMA gives buyers and their real estate agents an
accurate perspective on what the most recent sales have been in the area. It looks at prices for similar
homes within certain neighborhoods or within a half mile radius of the perspective home. Armed with
a CMA, the buyer will be far less apt to overpay for a property. This way, instead of “Mr. Know-It-
All” using his all-knowing gut feelings and spidey senses to come up with a good offer, we actually
used real-time factual sales data to back up our hunches.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the list price of the particular house that he had looked at half a dozen times
was impacted by the low supply and high demand trends that were prevalent at that time. By the time
he finally got around to making an offer, there were four other prospective buyers who put forth
proposals to purchase the very same home.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t you know it, after intense negotiations between my client, me, the seller, and the seller’s
agent, Mr. Know-It-All’s bid was the one they accepted! My client was relieved and eager to get to
the closing table so that he could vacate his rented condo and occupy his new home.</p>
<p>At that point, I was just as excited for him to move into the home as he was. However, just as I do
with all of my clients, I urged him to get a home inspection performed by a professionally licensed
and certified inspector. In his offer, we did not waive his right to an inspection, so he was well within
his right to do so. But Mr. Know-It-All was rather annoyed that he had wound up in a bidding war to
buy the property. Annoyance turned into impatience, and he dismissed the notion of needing to get a
home inspection. In his eyes, it was an unnecessary expense that would prolong his month-to-month
condo lease and further delay his impending move. No matter how much I begged and pleaded with
him throughout the course of ten days, he refused to budge.</p>
<p>“I appreciate your guidance as my agent,” he insisted, “but I know everything there is to know
about the makeup of a house, and this one needs nothing more than some basic cosmetic work.”
“Okay, okay . . .” I replied. And what more could I do? According to the contract, we had only
four days left to complete the home inspection, or Mr. Know-It-All would then forfeit his right to have
one conducted prior to closing. As a last-ditch effort, I had one of the top home inspectors in the real
estate business give my client a call to give him a candid outlook on the possible pitfalls of skipping
an inspection. This, too, went in one ear and out the other. My buyer refused yet again.</p>
<p>Eventually, I came to the conclusion that I couldn’t change his mind, and conceded to his decision.
Then the real drama began.</p>
<p>After a quick closing on the house, my client officially became the new owner of an amazing
home. Screeeee-e-e-ech! Not so fast.</p>
<p>At first, everything went swimmingly. I called my client a couple of times during the week after
closing to make sure he was still enjoying his new digs and asked if there was anything of concern oritems that he needed help with in the home.</p>
<p>All was fine and dandy until he got to week number five. I remember it like it was yesterday. At
approximately 8:15 a.m. on a rainy Sunday morning, I was startled out of my peaceful slumber by my
cell phone ringing nonstop. I hit “ignore” and put the phone on vibrate, but the caller was persistent.</p>
<p>Finally, I picked up.<br/>
“Hello?” I said, perturbed. <br/>
Wouldn’t you know it? Mr. Know-It-All was calling, and he was heated! I could almost see the
fire breathing through the receiver as he yelled.</p>
<p>Apparently he was in Asia on a business trip, and while his housekeeper was at his house to do
her bi-weekly cleaning, she discovered nearly two feet of water rising in his basement. The sump
pump that was supposed to turn on automatically to suction water off the floor, never turned itself on.</p>
<p>A torrential storm had caused a power outage on the entire block. Although the outage was temporary
for most of the neighborhood, at my client’s house the electricity never came back on. And without
him being there, he was unaware of the problem.</p>
<p>Once he hastily returned home from his business trip, Mr. Know-It-All discovered an electrical
problem with the circuit breaker panel that had been installed by the previous owner of the house.
When the storm tripped the electrical box, the power never kicked back on, while the other homes
nearby got their power back right away. From that instant, there was a domino effect of one problem
after the next.</p>
<p>With no power on in the house, all of the food in his refrigerator had defrosted and gone bad.</p>
<p>Then the water from the frozen items that dethawed leaked out of the freezer onto the hardwood floors
in his kitchen and ruined them.</p>
<p>I never like to be the one to say, “I told you so,” but in the back of my mind, I remembered begging
and pleading with this guy many times to get a home inspection. Although the homeowners insurance
covered most of the damage, he now had a $20,000 repair tab and had to take off a week from his job
to oversee the work being done. This catastrophe could have easily been avoided if he just listened in
the first place and gotten a home inspection.</p>
<p>The moral of the story is this: I always tell my Property Virgins to never skip the home inspection!
It is a crucial  part of purchasing your home. Home inspections are designed to protect you from
unexpected repairs and costs after move-in. If any problems are found during a pre-sale inspection,
the  buyer  can  then  negotiate  with  the  seller  to  have  the  issues  resolved  before  closing,  or  to
incorporate the cost of repairs into the offer.</p>

<div class="flex-rectangle"><h2>CHILL PILL #19</h2>
<p>The $300–400 you pay for a home inspection up front can save you loads of time, money, and
heartache on the back end. Charge it off as one of the necessary costs associated with
purchasing a home. As Nike says, <em>just do it!</em></p></div>

  <h2>CHAPTER 9<br/>
APPRAISALS:<br/>
Comps, Reports, Results . . . Oh My!</h2>

  <p><strong>YOU’VE FOUND THE HOME OF YOUR DREAMS AND</strong> they’re  asking $275,000.
You already have an approval for that amount from your bank. But is the house really
worth that amount? That’s the question at the center of any home appraisal. The worth or
value of the property will determine how much a lender is willing to give you to buy that
particular piece of real estate.</p>
<p>Once you apply for your mortgage, the lender orders an appraisal of the home. This will usually
occur right after your inspection is completed.</p>
<p>A home appraisal is a vital step in getting the financing you need to purchase, but a bad appraisal
can kill the deal. The appraisal can also be a confusing part of the homebuying process in which both
buyer and seller must depend on the expert opinion of an outsider. A real estate appraisal is simply
that—the expert opinion of a certified, state-licensed professional  who determines the value of a
piece of property. If your $500,000 dream home is really worth only $430,000, then the home is
overpriced.</p>
<p>A home appraisal also protects your mortgage company from getting stuck with a property that’s
worth less than they’ve loaned to the borrower on a mortgage. Look at it this way: It protects you
from paying too much for a house simply because it was love at first sight. The home appraisal is a
no-nonsense factor in a decision that is often emotional for the buyer.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER 10<br/>
COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID:<br/>
Home Buying No-No’s</h2>

<p><strong>PURCHASING  A HOUSE  FOR THE  FIRST-TIME,  OR EVEN</strong> the  second,  third,  or
fourth time can be a great experience. Or it can be a nightmare, if you don’t avoid some of
the common mistakes unwary buyers often make. Of course, my goal in writing this book is
so you will have a pleasant and memorable experience in purchasing your first property, and
end up with a home you love.</p>
<p>I once worked with a Property Virgin that I called Tweet. It was a funny nickname I gave her after
working together for two weeks. Each time she saw a home feature that she loved, she would jump up
and down and make a high-pitched chirp like a bird. No, I’m not joking! Her mother was assisting her
in the search and informed me that she had been “tweeting or chirping” since childhood . . . LOL.</p>
<p>As I drove to meet her at what would later be called her “dream home,” the seller’s agent called
to advise me that the homeowner would be there while we toured. It’s never a good idea to tour a
home with the homeowner looking over your shoulder and listening intently to client feedback. But
since we were already on our way, there was really nothing that could be done. As we walked up to
the front door, I advised Tweet to try and contain her emotion because the seller would be present. If
we decided to make an offer later on, we’d want to maintain our poker face to keep the upper hand.</p>
<p>As we walked through the foyer into the great room, I noticed a huge smile come over my client’s
face. The good news was that she loved it. The bad news was that the seller knew it. We continued
into the kitchen and dining room, and the tweeting started. “Oh my goodness, this is it! I can’t believe
we’re standing in my kitchen,” she proclaimed. Uh oh. The seller stood in the entryway and heard the
entire proclamation. I asked the seller if she could give us a little privacy as we toured the rest of the
home, and as she obliged, I virtually shook the tweets out of Tweet. Unfortunately, it was too late.</p>
<p>Later that evening, we put in an offer on the house for $435,000. Considering the property was
listed for $449,000 and had been on the market for forty-two days without another offer, it was a fair
entry proposal. Wouldn’t you know it; the seller got cocky and wouldn’t budge. She refused to come
down one dollar. Tweet was stunned to find out the seller wanted full asking price and wasn’t willing
to negotiate. I suggested she sit on her offer for a week or two to let the seller get nervous. But Tweet
was adamant that she didn’t want to lose her “dream house” and didn’t want to take any chances.</p>
<p>Sadly, she wound up paying full asking price, all because she couldn’t contain her emotions.This leads me into the common pitfalls to avoid when purchasing a house.</p>

THE TITLE SCRUB DOWN:<br/>
Not All Title Companies Are Created Equal</h2>
  <p><strong>YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT IN CHAPTER 7 WE TOUCHED</strong> upon the possibility
of using a real  estate attorney to oversee the closing or  “settlement” process. Another
option is to hire a title company. The cornerstone of this phase of the real estate purchase
transaction  is  filing  or  recording  the  deed  or  title  to  the  property  with  the  local
municipality in which you are buying. Once submitted and registered, this document makes the home
officially yours.
Most people are quite bewildered when it comes to the title and obtaining title insurance. What is
it? What is the purpose?</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER 12<br/>
THE CLOSING TABLE:<br/>
The Final Frontier</h2>
  <p>AWESOME!  IF YOU’VE  MADE  IT  OVER  MOST  OF THE  hurdles  and  taken the
advice I’ve given you thus far, then perhaps you will find yourself sitting with your real
estate agent and real estate attorney at the closing table.</p>
<p>It can be nerve-wracking, yet exciting when you are presented with a big contract in
which you will be required to “sign your life away.” But really, this is where your new life as a
homeowner begins. You should be thrilled that you finally made it to the table. I hope you’re smiling
from ear to ear!</p>
<p>But wait; there are a few more things we must address before you sign on the dotted lines. In this
chapter, we will talk about homeowners insurance, private mortgage insurance, and how to prepare
and  exactly  what  to  expect  at  the  closing  table.  Ugh.  Doesn’t  sound  like  much  fun,  I  know.
Nevertheless, these are things you will have to sew up in order to close on your new house.</p>
<p>One  way to  ensure  all  is  going as  planned  is  to  tell  the  lender  that you want to  review  the
documents before closing. You should also ask your attorney to do so. A lot of people fail to do this,
and  when they get to  closing,  they are  embarrassed  to  ask questions  and  try to  rush through the
paperwork. That’s when trouble comes in. You should understand every single document you will be
signing upfront.</p>
<p>By law, you have the right to review the closing settlement statement, or the HUD-1 form, at least
twenty-four hours before closing. Compare that form to the good faith estimate you received when you
applied for the loan. It is also standard that you will be allowed a final walk-through inspection
twenty-four  hours  before  closing to  determine  if any damage  was  done  to  the  property between
contract and closing, and to negotiate any necessary repairs with the seller.</p>
<p>It is  important for  you to  bring to  the  closing table  every document received  throughout the
homebuying process. These include the good faith estimate and proof of homeowners insurance. It is
also wise to bring a copy of your original purchase contract and inspection, just in case you need to
refer to it for any reason.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to bring a bank check for the amount you were stated. Many buyers are so anxious on
closing day that they forget they need to stop at the bank to get the check. Get the check at least a day
or two in advance. The other most important thing a homebuyer can bring to the closing table ispatience! Closings usually take one to three hours and that’s on a standard closing with no hiccups.</p>
<p>I’ve been to closings that have lasted the greater part of a day. This is definitely something you don’t
want to try and schedule during a lunch break.</p>
<p>Another important piece of advice: Expect the unexpected! Human error is common, and one of
the  biggest delays  in closings  tends  to  be  errors  on the  mortgage  documents.  Imagine  you were
approved for an interest rate of 3.25 percent but the mortgage docs say 4.98 percent. Would you feel
comfortable signing it? Absolutely not! The changes will have to be made by the mortgage company
before the closing can continue. Delays, delays, delays.</p>
<p>This kind of situation is why I reiterate reading everything in great detail ahead of time. If a
document doesn’t look familiar, take your time and ask questions. You want to know what you’re
signing!</p>
<p>I also recommend trying to schedule your closing sometime around the end of the month, but not
on the last day of the month. The last day of the month is the day most often requested for closing
because the closer you are to the end of the month, the less closing costs tend to be. That’s because
prepaid interest due at closing accumulates throughout the month, but can be avoided or reduced if the
closing is near the end of the month.</p>
<p>What if something goes wrong and you aren’t able to close that day? What if closing lasts until
evening and the mortgage company closes before you’re finished? What if there is a computer error or
the fax or printer is on the fritz? I’ll tell you what happens: Everything gets pushed to the top of the
next month and then your closing costs are increased due to taxes and interest for a full month, versus
a pro-rated month being due. So it’s in your best interest to review the documents ahead of time and
catch any errors before they get to the table.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER 13<br/>
UNLOCKING THE DOORS TO YOUR NEW
HOME:<br/>
Now What?</h2>

<p><strong>WHEW! AFTER YOU GET UP FROM THE CLOSING</strong> table and shake hands with
all of the parties who are present, it might be tempting to jump up and down or do a
little dance. It’s like hitting a home run or scoring a touchdown, except now you are
officially a new homeowner! You should have a profound sense of freedom and relief.</p>
<p>I often feel like jumping up and down with my clients, because I get so close to them throughout
the process. I learn about their families, and we develop a personal connection. It’s a great feeling for
me, too, when I see a couple or family who has finally reached their dream of homeownership.</p>
<p>When the seller finally hands over the keys to your new home, it can feel surreal. It is a much
more rewarding experience than getting the keys to a rental  apartment or any place you’ve lived
before. Now you have a place that is truly yours! It is not just a house; it is a home.</p>
<p>Owning a home can represent many different things. For some people, it may mean stability for
their  family.  For  others,  it  may  provide  financial  security,  since  mortgage  payments  are  often
significantly less than what you pay in rent.</p>
<p>However, just because  you finally have  the  keys  in your  hand, the  transaction is  not entirely
finished. Sure, you can do your happy dance if you like! You’ve earned it. Then, after you are done
dancing around the living room and buying new plants and homey decorations and making a list of
whom to invite to your housewarming party, remember to do the following twenty-one things.</p>
<p>What?! The work’s not over yet? No, not quite. Smart buyers take the time to prepare their home
before move-in and to learn all the nuances of their property. Even a brand-new home in move-in
condition will require upkeep. Completing this brief checklist within the first two weeks of your
closing date will give you greater peace of mind that you have done everything in your power to make
homeownership a joyful and pleasant experience.</p>
<p>Rest easy. I promise this list is easier than what you’ve just been through finding and purchasing
your new home!</p>

<h3>THINGS TO DO AFTER YOU TAKE OVER OWNERSHIP OF YOUR NEW PLACE:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Call to make utility bill transfers.</li>
<li>Change the locks on the doors.</li>
<li>Make sure the latches and locks on all the windows are functioning correctly.</li>
<li> Set up home security, if necessary.<br>
  </li>
<li>Call pest control and have your new house treated, both interior and exterior to just to be
  safe against termites and rodents.</li>
<li>Look for local landscapers if you are not in an HOA community that covers it.</li>
<li>Find a handyman who can help you with small repairs around the house.</li>
<li>Change the air filters (and continue to do so monthly or bi-monthly).</li>
<li>Get the dryer vents cleaned to avoid a fire.</li>
<li> Check the date the hot water heater was last bled.</li>
<li> Give the house another deep cleaning; you can never be too sure even if it “looks” clean or is “broom clean.”</li>
<li> Get moved in.</li>
<li> Unpack your boxes.</li>
<li> Drive around and learn shortcuts and discover where things like the nearest grocery store and gas station are located.</li>
<li> Get blinds and curtains.</li>
<li> Introduce your family to the neighbors.</li>
<li> Two weeks after closing, contact local municipalities to make sure the deed has beentransferred properly.</li>
<li> Redirect your mail to your new address.</li>
<li> Decorate with paint, shelving, etc.</li>
<li> Take  pictures  or  record  a  video  of your  new  home  and  belongings  to  give  to  the 
  insurance company.</li>
<li> Most of all, relax! You deserve it.</li>
</ol>

<p>Additionally, there are items that you should always keep around your home just in case of an
emergency. I call it the “smart home shoppers list.” The next time you go to the store, be sure to throw
these items in your cart.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Candles</li>
  <li> Matches or lighters</li>
  <li> Blankets</li>
  <li> Light bulbs</li>
  <li> Flashlight</li>
  <li> Rope</li>
  <li> A hunting knife</li>
  <li> Ladder</li>
  <li> Batteries</li>
  <li> An assortment of screwdrivers</li>
  <li> At least one case of water</li>
  <li>Canned foods</li>
  <li> Manual can opener</li>
</ul>
<p>These are items that you should have in your home at all times just in case you need them. And if
there is ever a local or regional state of emergency, such as a blackout or flood, you will have the
bare necessities to tide you over.</p>
<p>I hope I’ve simplified the home-buying process for you to feel confident about taking the leap.
There’s no doubt that buying a house is one of the biggest purchases of your life, but remember to
keep calm . . . you can do this. Not just anyone can buy a house, especially these days. It takes a very,
very special and prepared person to be able to close the deal, which is a good thing, at least in my
book! The handy index at the end should help you skip straight to the sections you need for reference.</p>
<p>And speaking of my book, I really want this to be your book. I hope this becomes your go-to guide
for every step that must be taken on your road to homeownership. I don’t expect you to memorize my
tips and explanations. But keep the book handy. When the time comes for a brushup, just go back and
reread the chapter pertaining to the milestone you have reached. The saying, “Cross that bridge when
you get to it” applies here, meaning you can always open up to the chapter you need right before you
are ready to take that step.</p>
<p>Here’s my last bit of advice: Never get so discouraged that you give up! If owning your own home
is your dream, you can make it happen. For some people, the whole process of buying a home is scary
and foreign; whereas, others will enjoy it enough to do it again and again throughout their lives. I
hope you are one of those people who find joy and happiness when it comes to buying your own
piece of the earth.</p>

  <h2>FINANCIAL MILESTONES TO HOMEOWNERSHIP</h2>
  
  <p>Let’s take a look at the financial milestones you’ll need to hit on your road to homeownership:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Prequalification</strong>. Getting prequalified is the initial step in the mortgage process, and it’s
generally fairly simple. You supply a bank or lender with your overall financial picture,
including your debt, income, and assets. After evaluating this information, a lender can give you
an idea of the mortgage amount for which you qualify. Prequalification can be done over the
phone or on the internet, and there is usually no cost involved.</p></li>

<li>
  <p><strong>Preapproval</strong>. Getting preapproved is the next step, and it tends to be much more involved.
You’ll complete an official mortgage application (and usually pay an application fee), and then
supply the lender with the necessary documentation to perform an extensive check on your
financial background and current credit rating. (Typically at this stage, you will not have found a
house yet, so any reference to “property” on the application will be left blank.) From this, thelender can tell you the specific mortgage amount for which you are preapproved. You’ll also
have a better idea of the interest rate you will be charged on the loan and, in some cases, you
might be able to lock in a specific rate. With preapproval, you will receive a conditional
commitment in writing for an exact loan amount, allowing you to look for a home at or below
that price level. Obviously, this puts you at an advantage when dealing with a potential seller, as
he or she will know you’re one step closer to obtaining an actual mortgage.</p></li>

<div class="flex-rectangle"><h2>CHILL PILL #13</h2>
<p>Before you look at any homes, it’s best if you go straight to the preapproval process. This way,
you won’t waste time with guessing or looking at properties that are beyond your means.
Getting preapproved also enables you to move quickly when you find the perfect place. In a
competitive market, this lets the seller know that your offer is serious—and could prevent you
from losing out to another potential buyer who already has financing arranged. If you’re going
to take time to get prequalified, you might as well go a few steps further and go for the
preapproval.</p></div>

<li><p> <strong>Mortgage Commitment</strong>. While preapproval is what you obtain before you begin searching
for a home, the next step—a mortgage commitment—is what you obtain after you’ve found your
home and are officially “under contract.” A mortgage commitment from a lender means you have
submitted a Uniform Residential Loan Application, copy of a photo ID, pay stubs, verification of
employment, bank statements, the last two years of your W-2s or 1099 statements, the last two
years of your tax returns, and verification of deposits for your down payment. Once the lender’s
evaluation is completed, they issue a letter verifying your mortgage commitment.<br/>
It’s important to note that the commitment is based on the income, credit, and other
information that was approved. If anything should change, then your commitment can be revoked
or amended. This means that you can’t stop paying your bills, buy two new cars, or quit your
job, and remain approved. No mortgage loan is one hundred percent approved until it is closed.</p></li>

<li>
  <p><strong>Final Approval</strong>. Once all the property reports are in hand, as well as the additional list of
items required for initial underwriting, the file goes back to the underwriter for final sign off.
(The underwriter is the person/department at the bank who processes and approves your loan.)
At this point, the underwriter could fully sign off on the file as ready to fund, or ask for
additional documentation. Remember to keep calm. . . This is normally the step where buyers
lose patience. It’s fairly common for banks to request further documents or clarification on an
item you’ve already turned in. After they’ve checked through everything, a final approval letter
will specify the amount and type of the loan that’s been approved, free of any additional
conditions or “subject to’s.” A final approval, unlike a pre-qualification or preapproval, means
your financing has been secured.</p></li>

    <div data-role="collapsible">
      <h3> Prove Your Stability</h3>
      <p>If you jump around to different jobs faster than the seasons change,
then this might alarm the bank. They want to see consistency in your paychecks over a long
period of time.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
      <h3>Keep Your Credit Score  High</h3>
      <p>Be vigilant about not letting your  credit score drop.
Freecreditreport.com and other sites offer free annual credit reports. Generally speaking, it’s
wise to pull your credit report annually to ensure nothing is reported negatively. Even one
small change can alarm the bank. Buyers with credit scores over the 700 mark typically have
more leverage in securing the best possible interest rates. You will learn more about credit
scores later in this chapter.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
      <h3> Lower Your Debt-to-Credit Ratio</h3>
      <p> Even if you have good credit, if you have a lot of
credit cards with high maximum limits, this can be a disadvantage for you. Why? Well, when
times get tough for people, they often turn to credit cards to get caught up, which can put them
further and further behind the eight-ball. Banks would rather see low maximum limits with low
balances.  I  would  recommend  keeping  no  more  than  three  or  four  cards  that  you  use
occasionally and then cutting up or paying off the rest.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
      <h3> Save Enough for the Down Payment and Closing Costs</h3>
      <p> Again, closing costs can equate to
approximately 3 to 5 percent of the loan, so saving only enough for the down payment can
leave you in a bind, which the bank will view unfavorably.</p>
    </div>
<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
      <h3>Pad Your Savings Account, Too!</h3>
      <p>On paper, this looks great in the eyes of the bank. They
will see that you have planned for those “just in case” mishaps that life often brings.</p>
    </div>
<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
      <h3> Pay Your Bills on Time</h3>
      <p>Do you pay your bills on time or do you accrue late fees even if
you have enough money to cover them? Late payments indicate irresponsibility to a mortgage
lender. Being busy or forgetful is understandable once in a while, but if payments on your auto,
utilities, or credit cards are always late, then banks will consider you at risk for late mortgage
payments.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
      <h3>Header</h3>
      <p>Content</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
      <h3>Have Your Paperwork Ready</h3>
      <p>Being organized and having proof of your job stability,
income, and credit history ready in advance shows the bank that you are a serious homebuyer
who is also prepared to take homeownership seriously.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
      <h3>Be  Accurate</h3>
      <p>Make  sure  none  of your  paperwork has  been falsified  or  is  outdated.
Banks want the most recent and up-to-date information about you to make their decision.</p>

  <h2>WHAT IS A CREDIT SCORE, AND WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?</h2>
  
  <p>A credit score is a number from 0 to 850, used by lenders to determine whether you are a risky or a
great candidate for them to extend a loan. People who have financial problems often have lower
scores because they are unable to keep up with their bills. They fall behind on payments, make late
payments, or sometimes ditch their financial obligations altogether since they are unable to pay them
back.</p>
<p>The FICO credit score is the one most creditors use. It includes three organizations that offer a
combined  number  to  tally your  score.  They are  Equifax,  TransUnion,  and  Experian.  Everyone  is
entitled to a free credit score once each year. Additionally, you can often get one through your bank
for free.</p><br/>

  <h2>TEN WAYS TO IMPROVE YOUR CREDIT AND SCORE
YOURSELF THE BEST MORTGAGE</h2>

<p>One of the major factors in buying a new house is your credit score. Even if everything seems okay,
it’s best to check beforehand and gear up for this financial transition. Here are ten ways to keep your
credit score high:</p>

<div data-role="collapsible-set">
  <div data-role="collapsible">
    <h3>Pay on Time</h3>
    <p>Paying bills  on time  accounts  for  a  major  amount of your  score,  which is
determined by the Fair Isaac Corporation. It is a system and not a person, and therefore doesn’t
take into account that you had a bump in the road that caused the late payment.</p>
  </div>
  <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
    <h3>Keep Your Debt-to-Credit Ratio at 30 percent</h3>
    <p>What does this mean? If you have a
credit card with a limit of $2,000, make sure you do not carry a balance over $600.</p>
  </div>
  <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
    <h3>Pay Things Off</h3>
    <p>If you want to increase your score and are able to pay something off—
even something small—do so. This brings your credit score up! So take a look at that car loan.
If you only have a couple of grand left to pay it off, why not use your tax refund to improve
your credit and feel great about having one less payment every month?</p>
  </div>
  <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
    <h3>Dispute Wrongdoings</h3>
    <p>Credit card companies are notorious for errors, so if you spot
something on your credit report that is not true, you can absolutely contest it. Many people do
not take the time to look or to dispute things even when they feel as though they have been
wronged. It helps if you keep documentation, but generally you are allowed to have at least one
faulty transaction taken off your record each year.</p>
  </div>
  <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
    <h3> Tackle  Credit  Card Debt</h3>
    <p> It can be  good  to  have  a  few  credit cards  that you pay
responsibly, but if you open up your wallet and twenty cards fall out, it might be time to whittle
down that debt. Make a list of what you owe on each card and start paying them down. Tacklethe smaller and more recent cards first, and then close those accounts after they are paid. Keep
the long-standing cards, but get them down to that 30 percent ratio I mentioned in Tip #2.</p>
  </div>
  <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
    <h3>Show Variety</h3>
    <p>Just when I tell you to get rid of some of those cards, now I’m telling you
to mix it up. Hear me out . . . If you have only one bill for $5,000 and another person has three
bills equaling the same amount and you are both paying on time, the second person is more
likely to have a higher score. So spread your credit card use around.</p>
  </div>
  <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
    <h3> Clear Up Past Bank Problems</h3>
    <p>If you have ever stiffed a bank that charged you a lot of
fees for one bounced check that spiraled out of control, rather than letting the account drop and
never going back to the bank, you must make amends. The money you owe will affect your
ability to open any future accounts with other banks because the default shows on the system
(seemingly forever).</p>
  </div>
  <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
    <h3>Stay Put</h3>
    <p>Stability is a good way to show that you are fiscally responsible, so if you
move around a lot, it actually harms your credit. Of course, this isn’t necessarily your fault.
You may find a job that requires you to move. Life situations arise (which they do!), but this is
one more tip you can store in your memory bank.</p>
  </div>
  <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
    <h3>Avoid Credit Card Offers</h3>
    <p>It’s tempting when you receive “No Interest” offers to transfer
balances to another card, but read the fine print before you do. Jumping from one credit card
company to another can actually harm your credit.</p>
  </div>
  <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
    <h3>Say “No” to Incentive Sign-Ups</h3>
    <p>When you go to department stores, the sales clerk
will frequently ask you to save 10 percent or more on your purchase by signing up for a store
card. Not only does this hurt your credit with extra inquiries, but having more cards will have
a negative impact on your score.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="flex-rectangle"><h2>CHILL PILL #14</h2>
<p>Disputing things on your credit report places the burden of proof on the creditor, so if you feel
that you have been wronged, you should absolutely try to get it amended! It also doesn’t hurt to
put a fraud protection alert on your credit report. This makes it so that no one can open
accounts in your name without a security code. It’s a great protection from fraud!</p></div>

  <h2>HOW TO AVOID DAMAGING YOUR CREDIT SCORE</h2>
  <p>Before you try to improve your credit score, you must find out exactly what the score is. Sometimes
people ruin their scores without meaning to, often thinking they are improving it by certain actions.
For example, canceling a credit card can actually damage your score if the card has a high limit and
low balance. Sounds a bit ridiculous, but credit bureaus use a calculation of your available credit
versus how much you owe to help determine the score, which means that canceling that card can then
increase your debt-to-credit ratio.</p>
<p>Another surprising way your credit score can be harmed is by forgetting to take a book back to the
library. A simple, yet seemingly harmless $15 book can lower your score by as much as a hundred
points! That is only if the library reports the book to a collection agency, which in some cities they
do.</p>
<p>Many  people  find  past  medical  bills  coming  back  to  haunt  them.  That  trip  you  took  to  the
emergency room a few years ago and forgot to pay can cost you a lot of points. Hospitals and medical
facilities almost always report past-due balances. It’s better to work out a payment arrangement if you
cannot pay for the services at the time it happened. I know a person whose $1,400 medical bill from
years before caused him to get rejected for a traditional loan, and therefore he had to pay a much
higher interest rate. You can see now how some of these minor delinquencies can be detrimental,
especially when you are talking about the difference between paying a 3.5 percent interest rate versus
a 6 percent interest rate on a mortgage. In the long run, it will equal thousands of dollars more than it
would have cost you to simply work out a payment arrangement with the hospital.</p>
<p>But the worst factor that will cost you major points is paying bills late. According to the way
scores are calculated, you’re sending a message that collecting payments will be problematic for
them.</p>
<p>How can you avoid these seemingly innocent catastrophes? Call the company you owe and work
out a payment arrangement. That way you cannot be penalized for being a few days late and you will
still continue making a concerted effort to keep your credit score as high as possible.</p>

<div class="flex-rectangle"><h2>CHILL PILL #15</h2>
<p>If you think that paying back past credit card debt from a few years ago will help you, think
again! Once your debt has been charged-off (written off as a lost cause) by a credit card
company, any recent activity, like paying the debt down, will make your debts appear recent,
too. The scoring system will then penalize you. Not fair, but true! It takes seven years to wipe a
negative mark off your credit report, so ride it out if it has been close to that long. However, if
you have any charge-offs that are more recent (say, within the past year or so), then try to work
out an arrangement.</p></div>

  <h2>EENIE-MEENIE-MINEY MORTGAGE: WHICH HOME LOAN IS
RIGHT FOR YOU?</h2>



<p>Let’s say you have already gone through the preapproval process. You’re excited because the bank
told you that you have “buying power” of up to $300,000. Whoopee! You start looking at homes in the
$300k price range. Wait a minute, the voice of reason whispers in your ear. Isn’t there more to this?
Then it starts tapping you on the shoulder, and finally it tries to get your attention in other ways.
Before you start bidding on your dream home, a bit more busywork is in order. You already know
to factor in the taxes, insurance, and closing costs. But what’s the bottom line going to be each month?
It all depends on your mortgage.</p>
<p>Determining which mortgage is best for your circumstances is probably one of the most common
questions asked by those who are in the market to purchase a home. There are conventional, variable
rates, ARM loans, and FHA or VA loans to choose from. Eenie, Meenie, Miney, Mortgage! So how do
you determine which is right for you?</p>
<p>Basically, it comes down to just a few things. Do you prefer a mortage whose rate is higher but
will stay the same, or is lower to start with but may vary over time? Do you want a conventional or
government-backed loan?</p>
<p>Just a few years ago, during the housing boom, there were enough mortgage options to make your
head spin. During that period, lenders were essentially tailoring their mortgage products to suit the
borrower, whether they were qualified or not. Those were the days of money-back loans and zero due
at closing. The subprime lending disaster ultimately led to the housing crash and foreclosure crisis.
These days, however, the government has placed more stringent restrictions on the lending world.
Those riskier mortgages are no longer an option and most lenders primarily require a 10 to 20 percent
down payment. Although they’re now tougher to get than they used to be, people have become wiser
about them through making sound financial decisions and by knowing their options.
So, what are some of the different types of mortgages? The three most common mortgages are FHA loans, VA loans, and conventional loans:</p>

<ul>
<li>
  <p><strong>FHA Loans</strong>: An FHA loan is a government-insured loan offered to first-time homebuyers.
Federal Housing Administration–approved lenders provide loans aimed at first-time buyers’
special needs. These loans offer higher loan-to-value rates, fixed or adjustable interest rates,
and less-demanding requirements for income and down payments than conventional loans. For
instance, the FHA permits first-time buyers to borrow up to 97 percent of the value of the
property. When people talk about 3 to 3.5 percent down options, they are referring to an FHA
loan.</p></li>

<li><strong>VA Loans</strong>: A VA loan is also a government-backed loan, but this particular loan is overseen
  by the Department of Veterans Affairs. It was designed solely for American veterans and their
  spouses. It allows US veterans to purchase a home with no down payment and 103.3 percent
  financing without private mortgage insurance. The additional 3.3 percent is to cover closing
  costs.</li>

<li><p><strong>Conventional Loans</strong>: A conventional loan is neither made by a government entity, nor
  insured by a government entity. It’s what we refer to as a non-GSE (non-government sponsored
  entity) loan. A conventional, or conforming, mortgage can be backed by a bank, credit union, or
  savings and loan association and adheres to the guidelines set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,
  that is, the Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage
  Corporation. A conventional mortgage may have either a fixed or adjustable rate.</p></li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FHA, VA, AND CONVENTIONAL LOANS?</h3>

<p>The  main difference  between these  loans  is  who  can qualify for  them,  as  defined  above.  Down
payment requirements are different as well. The minimum down payment for an FHA loan is 3.5
percent. For a VA loan, the minimum down payment is zero. For a conventional loan you can expect
anywhere from 5 percent down to 20 percent down. However, with conventional loans, if you put less
than 20 percent down on your mortgage, you’ll get hit with something called PMI, or private mortgage
insurance, which was mentioned in <a href="#ch5">Chapter 5</a>. It can add thousands of dollars on top of your annual
mortgage expense. If you put down less than 20 percent on your conventional loan, you will have to
pay monthly PMI until  you have  built  up  enough equity in your  home  that  the  lender  no  longer
considers you a risk. With PMI, the higher your loan, the more you pay.<br/>
Within the conventional loan perameters, you will have the option of a fixed-rate or an adjustable
rate:</p>  

<ul>
<li><p> Fixed-Rate Mortgage: Fixed-rate mortgages are also referred to as “conventional loans.”With the fixed-rate option, you’ll have the same interest rate for the entire life of the loan. This is
true whether you keep the loan for fifteen or thirty years. Keep in mind that your mortgage
payment can still change even with a fixed-rate. This is normally caused by an increase or
decrease in taxes, insurance, or escrow. However, the guaranteed fixed interest rate will always
remain the same for the life of the loan.</p></li>

<li><p>Adjustable-Rate Mortgage: An adjustable-rate mortgage, commonly known as an ARM
mortgage, is the direct opposite of the fixed-rate loan. The interest rate fluctuates over the life of
the loan, depending on market conditions. It can go up or down, but I have very rarely seen it go
down, except after the housing bust, when mortgage rates hit record lows. It’s the exception, not
the rule. To sum it up, an ARM mortgage means that your overall mortgage payment is
guaranteed to change in some capacity over the life of the loan.</p></li>

<li><p> Mixed-Rate Mortgage: Some people also call these “combo” loans or hybrids. You may
see lenders offer 5/1 ARM, 7/1 ARM, or 10/1 ARM mortgages. The idea is that the bank
mirrors the fixed-rate conventional loan for a set period of time (the first number in the term),
and begins to adjust after that time expires. Personally speaking, I once had a 7/1 ARM mortgage
at 5.75 percent. The interest rate remained the same for the first seven years of the loan, and then
began adjusting every year after the seventh year. Eventually, my mortgage rate would have been
over 8 percent, had I not been ready to sell and move into another home.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You may be wondering why anyone would choose an ARM or mixed loan versus a guaranteed
fixed-rate. The simple answer is that combo mortgages generally offer a lower interest rate than a
fixed-rate loan, at least in the beginning. Some homebuyers prefer a lower monthly payment during the
first few years of homeownership, so they opt for the ARM. Also, if you don’t plan on staying in the
home for a long period of time, it may make sense to choose an ARM mortgage. If you know that you
plan to move in eight years or that your home purchase is not your permanent residence, then a 10/1
ARM mortgage makes perfect sense because you will be able to get out of the home and move into the
next one before the rate adjusts.</p>
<p>These days, I tend to prefer fixed-rate mortgages. After all, nobody likes unpleasant surprises
when it comes to interest rates. Seven years can seem like a long ways away, but it goes by fast! You
may appreciate the security of a guaranteed fixed interest rate loan. While it’s true that you will pay a
higher rate than the initial rate on an ARM loan, at least you won’t have to guess. That’s like trying to
guess which horse will win a race for you next year. What if the horse gets injured? It’s better to put
your money on a sure bet than to gamble with fluctuating terms.</p>
<p>At the time of this app’s publication, interest rates are still at all-time lows, so it makes perfect
sense to lock into a low, fixed-rate. Ultimately, you will have to decide which mortgage product suits
your needs and lifestyle.</p>
<p><strong>Now, let’s go back to talk more about FHA loans.</strong> If you’re a first-time homebuyer, this may be
just the ticket for you. In fact, the rules for who is a first-time buyer may be less strict than you think:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>According to the Internal Revenue Service, you can be considered a “first-time” homebuyer
if it has been three or more years since you owned a home. This rule only applies if the propertywill be your place of residency. It does not apply to investment properties.</p></li>

<li><p> If you are separated or divorced from your spouse, you can also qualify as a first-time
homebuyer, according to the Federal Housing Administration. One of the qualifiers is whether
you have ever owned a home with your spouse (the spouse has to be on the deed, as well). You
must also be a single parent or a displaced homemaker.</p></li>

<li><p>If you have only owned a primary residence that wasn’t permanently connected to land, such as a
mobile home, you would be considered a first-time homebuyer, according to the FHA.</p></li>

<li><p>You would also be considered a first-time homebuyer if you’ve owned property that wasn’t
up to code and would cost more to repair than to rebuild. Just as with the mobile home, it must
be the only property you’ve owned.</p></li>

<li><p>According to the IRS, minors are generally not considered purchasers of a home and
therefore don’t qualify as first-time homebuyers. The one exception is when the minor is
married. Even then, the minor’s spouse must be over eighteen to meet the criteria.</p></li>

</ul>

<h3>WHAT IS A GRADUATED PAYMENT LOAN?</h3>
  
 <p>FHA and VA loans aren’t the only options for a low-interest-rate loan. Another option for low income
buyers is the graduated payment loan.<br/>
Graduated payment mortgages are an alternative to conventional loans for low-income buyers
who expect their income to grow in the next five to ten years. Payments start so low they don’t even
cover the interest on the loan, but they increase each year. This program allows individuals to apply
for a mortgage much sooner than they would be able to through a conventional mortgage.</p>

<h3>WHAT IS A HOME EQUITY LOAN?</h3>

<p>In essence, home equity loans are second mortgages. Once you actually own a home, a loan can be
taken out against the value of your property in addition to your primary mortgage. These loans can
offer great benefits, but they certainly come attached with some large risks, as well.</p>
<p>Home equity loans or home equity lines of credit are based on the amount of equity you have built
up  in your  home.  For  instance,  if your  mortgage  balance  is  $150,000  but  your  home’s  value  is
$225,000, then you have $75,000 worth of equity in the home and would more than likely be eligible
for a home equity loan.</p>
<p>The advantages of these types of loans are that they allow homeowners to borrow a large sum of
cash against the value of their home, with the flexibility to use it for any purpose. Many people usesecond home loans for things like debt consolidation, home improvement, avoiding private mortgage
insurance (PMI), paying for college tuition, and investing in other properties. Other loans just aren’t
big enough to cover these types of expenses.</p>
<p>Another advantage of home equity loans is that they are considered safer by lenders than other
types. Why? Because they are secured by the house. In other words, banks will actually get something
back if you default on the loan. On the bright side, borrowers can usually land much lower interest
rates on second mortgages than on unsecured loans or credit cards.</p>
<p>Oh, and there are tax benefits in choosing second mortgages, as compared with other loans. The
interest for a second mortgage is tax deductible, unlike the interest from a credit card balance, for
instance.</p>
  
<h3>DISADVANTAGES OF SECOND MORTGAGES</h3>

<p>You knew it was coming, didn’t you? Even though banks consider second mortgages “safer” than
traditional  mortgages,  there  are  still  some  major  drawbacks  involved  with borrowing additional
money against your house. Most significantly, second loans are risky because if the homeowner is
unable to repay the loan for whatever reason (like getting in over his head), he risks losing the house
to  foreclosure  and  in turn,  ruining his  credit.  The  risk of  foreclosure  does  not  exist  with other
unsecured loans. The hazards of a second loan should make borrowers seriously consider whether
they really need the large loan.</p>
<p>Also important to note: Second loans require fees and closing costs, just like first mortgages. You
may also be required to pay points (one point is equal to one percent of the loan value), which could
make the loan less attractive. And while second mortgage rates are certainly better than credit card
rates,  they  are  still  higher  than  first  mortgage  loans.  This  is  because  the  first  mortgage  takes
precedence over the second in terms of repayment, in the case of default.
Second mortgages can be a great way to access lower-cost funding for certain major financial
ventures, as long as borrowers do not overreach by taking out more money than they can comfortably
afford to repay.</p>
<p>Whether we’re talking about first or second mortgages, be sure to shop for low-cost loans among
mortgage lenders. Banks want your business, but they are not so eager to part with the money for the
loan. They want to make sure they recover their money and that you will be dependable in repaying it.
They know that you want to buy a home and live in it, and that having a home is the most important
bill you will pay each month. Somehow, the process is often complicated—no matter how great you
look on paper.  </p>

<div class="flex-rectangle"><h2>CHILL PILL #16</h2>
<p>Don’t forget to consider the taxes and insurance on your mortgage expense to avoid getting
stuck with untimely bills. The mortgage company will typically include this within your
monthly payments so that you pay throughout the year.</p></div>

  <h2>ARE YOU READY TO TAKE A LEAP OF FAITH?</h2>
  <p>When shopping for a home, you should be mindful of those you accept advice from and whether they
are qualified to give it to you. Do they have a vested interest in you purchasing the property? Family
members and friends are usually the ones inadvertently giving poor advice when it comes to real
estate. Market conditions are constantly fluctuating. Additionally, the housing climate can vary from
state to state. So you may be getting outdated or jaded advice. Rule of thumb: Listen to the experts!
<br/>Of  course,  if  you  are  married  or  in  a  partnership  with  someone  who  will  be  sharing
homeownership,  you should  be  conscious  of what your  individual  and  combined  goals  are.  The
purchase of a house is probably one of the biggest and most important decisions you will  make,
especially with a partner. Go into it with a clear mind and both feet firmly planted. Don’t allow
yourself to be talked into something you are uncomfortable with or unprepared for. Don’t let yourself
be rushed through the process if you’re not ready.</p>

<div class="flex-rectangle">
<H2>CHILL PILL #2</H2>
<p>Take real estate advice strictly from the professionals. Family and friends mean well but can
give you bad information. Consult with a qualified real estate professional who has the
experience to back up their advice—and who can offer you an impartial perspective as an
outsider.</p>
</div>
<p>You may still be wondering if you are even ready to buy a house. There are a lot of factors to
consider: your personal finances, whether your job will stay where you are, whether you can afford to
buy in the neighborhood where you’d like to live. Only you can decide if homeownership is the right
step for you. But by the time you finish this app, you’ll have the proper information and tools to
make an educated choice and move forward with confidence.
Consider the following ten things first. If you respond favorably to most of them—let’s say seven
out of the ten—then you may indeed be a terrific candidate for owning your own home.</p>

<h3>TOP TEN THINGS TO CONSIDER BEFORE BUYING A HOME</h3>

<ol>
<li>
 <p>Given your particular circumstances, how long would you see yourself living in your
   new home? Five years? Ten? Longer? If your answer is five years or more, then buying real
   estate is a smart move, since the money you will spend every year on rent is only making your
   landlord wealthy for the long term.</p>
 </li>

<li><p>Would you be doing it for the right reasons? Would you be purchasing because it’s a
personal goal? Or is this someone else’s goal for your life? Outside pressure should not be a
factor. Buying a house can cause some anxiety, yes, but ideally you will find joy in the process.
If you feel good about wanting a home of your own, then that is the right feeling to have!</p></li>

<li><p>What does your financial picture look like? Do you have a significant down payment
saved up? One lesson learned by so many millions of homeowners within the past few years is
that the “no money down” method was a disaster. Banks are more cautious than ever, and most
prefer having at least 20 percent of the purchase price as a down payment. Lucky for you, there
are many first-time homebuyer programs that will allow you to put as little as 3–3.5 percent
down. You can find more about this in my chapter on mortgages.</p></li>

<li><p>Do you have a financial contingency plan or back up in case something happens? After
shelling out the down payment, you don’t want to be caught using up your last resources in case
your water heater breaks, or your roof starts to leak. Make sure your investment is sound, but
plan ahead! You should also make a solid spreadsheet to determine your monthly expenses andbudget. Be organized to make sure you won’t get hit with late fees from the bank or be overrun
by high utility bills, which can really tap into your  resources  and make  homeownership a
stressful experience.</p></li>

<li><p> How sure are you about your job? If your job is unsteady or if you have been in your
workplace for less than five years, make sure your position is stable. Of course life can dish
out surprises (“Want to tranfer to Hong Kong?”), but if you know that you will be able to
manage and that you are making enough to sustain your lifestyle, then buying a house can be
done with peace of mind.</p></li>

<li><p> Are you willing to make sacrifices? Having your own house means that you will  be
responsible if something breaks or needs repair. You can’t call up your landlord and ask for it
to  be  fixed.  You will  either  have  to  do  these  things  yourself or  hire  someone.  That  also
includes landscaping and other maintenance tasks that are often covered for you when you rent.</p></li>

<li><p> New or used? Although some people like to start from scratch and build a home on a
piece of land, most homes are bought from a previous owner—or multiple owners. Consider
whether or not you have the time, dedication, and will to build a home, or if you prefer the joys
of renovating.</p></li>

<li><p>Are you being realistic? You may wish to live by the ocean, but perhaps your budget only
enables you to live in a neighborhood with a pond nearby. Don’t overstretch your means, even
if you fall in love with something better than your initial comfort zone. Some pushy agents may
attempt to show you properties that are more expensive than what you planned, but if you keep
a realistic outlook and stay focused on your comfort zone, you can request only to see homes
that fall within your specific criteria.</p></li>

<li><p>In addition to your down payment, there will be costs such as closing fees, real estate
attorney fees, title fees, and even the cost of moving. Can you afford the up-front costs?</p></li>

<li><p>Finally, what do you need the home to give you to make this feel like a worthwhile
investment? If you plan to live there for less than five years, then my recommendation is to
reconsider buying. It can often take five years or longer to recoup the money that you pay in
closing costs. Oh my goodness . . . did I just say, “Don’t buy?” Those words are blasphemy
coming out of a real estate agent’s mouth. Nevertheless, truth is truth!</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It may be wise to make a list of all the pros and cons to buying a home. If there are downsides that
will take time to overcome (like not having enough for a down payment), then make a game plan
before jumping in with both feet.<br/>
But for those of you who are tired of living under someone else’s rules, having to deal with thin
walls, unpredictable neighbors, and throwing hard-earned rent money away, the prospect of owning ahome might be a dream come true. In most cases, it is!</p>

<h2>WHY ARE YOU MAKING YOUR LANDLORD RICH?</h2>
  
  <p>My personal belief is that when you rent, you make your landlord rich. It’s simple math. Add up your
rent and multiply it by twelve. You will be amazed at just how much you are padding that landlord’s
account! So whenever it makes the most sense, BUY! At least eight times out of ten, it makes more
sense to buy your own house instead of renting and having nothing to show after years of paying.
<br/>Wouldn’t you rather establish financial security for yourself? Nowadays, rentals are just about
equal with what a mortgage payment would cost (though you shouldn’t discount the extras, like paying
for your own maintenance and utilities and property taxes).
<br/>People have a number of reasons why they decide to rent versus buy. Their reasons vary wildly
depending on their  own personal  circumstances  or  life  scenarios.  Most of these  have  very little
connection with the  possibilities  of homeownership,  or  whether  the  person can actually afford  a
home. Here are the most common objections I hear:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>I’ve lived in an apartment my entire life and just never thought I could be a candidate for
homeownership. (Well surprise!!! You certainly can.)</li>
  <li>I screwed up my credit up when I was younger. I’m sure no bank will finance me, so why
bother? (Credit scores fluctuate all the time. Debts you incurred five years ago may no longer
be on your credit report. But you won’t know until you at least try.)</li>
<li>No one in my family has ever owned a home, so I didn’t think I could be an owner. (Why
not be the first? Set an example for the rest of your family and future generations. When they
see how you managed to accomplish owning a home, it may encourage them to do the same.)</li>
<li> Owning seems so much more expensive than renting. (Aha! That’s a big misconception.
Many times a mortgage works out to be cheaper than paying rent. Additionally, you get tax
incentives for homeownership. AND when you sell your home, for the most part you get your
investment back and then some. Renting works out to be much more expensive in the long
run.)</li>
<li> I just don’t want all of the responsibilities that come with owning a home. (Well, there is a
point I cannot rebut. If you’re not ready, you’re not ready.)</li>
</ul>

<p>These  are  all  valid  and  understandable  concerns.  However,  they  should  not  be  deterrents.
Everyone has hurdles to overcome, but if you do as you’ve always done, you’ll only get what you’vealways gotten. It’s easy to make excuses that allow you to stay in a comfort zone. Sometimes we have
to force ourselves to be uncomfortable in order to grow.</p>
<p>This reminds me of my personal experience of landing the job as host of Property Virgins. At the
time, I was a full-time real estate agent in New Jersey and a full-time radio personality in New York.
I knew my plate was already full when I received a call from a casting agent who wanted me to fly to
Toronto for an audition. Within the first minute after he mentioned it, I had already thought of ten good
reasons why I shouldn’t go. “I’ll waste my time flying there because they probably already have
another host in mind. I’ll have to take three days off my radio show, which my boss will frown at.
Better yet, if he finds out I took off to go on an audition, I’ll probably get fired.” I mean, you name
it, and I already said it to myself. But then a little voice inside said, “You are a great real estate
agent, so why wouldn’t they pick you? Give yourself a break. You said you wanted to get back into
television hosting, and now is your opportunity. Take a chance on yourself.”
</p><p>Well, I took that chance, bet on myself, and today not only do I get to educate viewers on a huge
international platform about the wonders of owning real estate, but I also got to write this app and
personally help you! It’s all because I dared to follow my dream and did the work to get there. I
believe you can and will do it, too.</p>

  <h2>THE REAL ESTATE REWIND: LET’S RECAP!</h2>
  
  <p>Use these three gauges to determine whether buying a home may make more sense than renting a place
to live:</p>
<ul>
<li> If you are looking for stability and long-term wealth, then it makes absolute sense to buy,
especially with mortgage interest rates still sitting at record lows. Many mortgage payments are
coming in lower than rent.</li>
<li> Be sure to consider the total cost of homeownership beyond the monthly mortgage payment.
Plan for your down payment, plus 3 to 5 percent more for closing costs. Maintenance will run an
average of 1 percent of your home’s price every year. Make sure you don’t forget insurance and
property taxes, but keep your eyes on the prize; the upside is the biggest deduction on your yearly
taxes.</li>
<li>Finally, ask yourself if you really want to be a homeowner. Are you the type of person who
enjoys weekly trips to a home improvement store, or would you rather just call your landlord to
come fix your squeaky floorboard? Do you mind moving around every two years, or would you
prefer to set down long-term roots?</li>

<h2>LIST OF 12 PROS FOR PROPERTY VIRGINS</h2>  
  <p>Only you can decide if the path to homeownership is the one you should take. But here are twelve
fantastic benefits to becoming a homeowner that you may not have thought of:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> <strong>Wealth Building:</strong> Real estate is a vital asset in building a foundation of wealth for your
family. Some people who own their property for an extended period of time are surprised to
see how much the value increases with eac decade.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>BBetter Management</strong>: Many people fail to call their landlord when something breaks—
or their landlord fails to make requested repairs—both of which leads to rentals that are in
disrepair. When you own your own home, the expenses to pay for repairs will come out of
your own pocket, but the benefit is in your ability to be in absolute control of your home’s
upkeep and make it a beautiful, reliable place to live.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Credit Score</strong>:  Making those  monthly payments  to  the  mortgage  company in a  timely
fashion will eventually give you great marks on your credit score. A mortgage in good standing
improves credit scores by leaps and bounds.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Tax Breaks:</strong> The US Tax Code lets you deduct the interest you pay on your mortgage, property
taxes, and certain costs associated with buying your home.</p></li>
<li><p> <strong>Appreciation:</strong> Real  estate  has  long-term,  stable  growth in value.  While  year-to-year
fluctuations are normal, median existing-home sale prices increased on average 6.5 percent
each year from 1972 through 2005. Because of the economy, we bottomed out for a few years
2006 to 2012. But the economy is back on track, and so are the benefits of owning real estate.
In addition, the number of US households is expected to rise 15 percent over the next decade,
creating continued high demand for housing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stability:</strong> If you plan on having a family—or if you have one already—owning a home is
a great benefit to your children. They like having a place of comfort to call “home” and often
feel  a  palpable  difference  between places  that are  “theirs”  versus  places  that are  rented.
Stability is essential to children, so take their well-being and feelings into account when you
make your decision.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Equity:</strong> Money paid for rent is money that you’ll never see again, but mortgage payments
let  you  build  equity  ownership  interest  in  your  home.  Although  the  average  rent  varies
depending on which state or region you live in, if you were paying $1,200 per month in rent for
a  two-or  three-bedroom apartment,  single-family  home,  or  condo,  then  you  can  kiss  that
$14,400 per year, good-bye forever, whereas, that money applied to a mortgage will go towardthe  principal.  You will  be  another  year  closer  to  owning your  home,  rather  than wasting
another year of your hard-earned money to pay the landlord’s mortgage.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Predictability</strong>: Unlike rent, your fixed-mortgage payments won’t increase over the years,
so your housing costs may actually decline the longer you own your home. However, bear in
mind that property taxes and insurance costs will increase.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pride</strong>: Having a home can give you a sense of fulfillment and achievement. You have
something you can be proud of—your own little piece of the earth!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Community</strong>:  When you have  your  own house,  it gives  you a  chance  to  bond  with
neighbors and other people in the neighborhood. They come to know you and vice versa, so
you’ll have more eyes to help you look out for your house in case of danger. When you rent, it
can be difficult to get to know people because renters are known for fluttering from one place
to the next.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pets</strong>: Having pets is a hassle when you rent. Aside from the extra deposit that is almost
always required, there is the fear of damage to the property. When you own a house, you don’t
need to ask permission to have a dog or a cat.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Freedom:</strong> The home is yours. You can decorate any way you like and benefit from your
investment for as long as you own the home. You’ll never have to ask permission to build a
deck, install a dish on your roof, change the carpet to hardwood flooring, or worry about your
landlord stopping by unexpectedly after your children just turned the place upside down. It’s
your place! You can do as you wish . . . well, almost. Sans a homeowners association.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Homeownership is a commitment. Once you know you want that commitment, and you’re sure it’s
right for you, then you can move forward and take the right steps to get into that house of your dreams.
If you’re ready, let’s take that first step!</p>

<li><strong>Commitment</strong>: Ability to focus their complete time and attention on you and your needs.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Communication</strong>: Ability to listen and respond to what you want, not just what they want to

<li><strong>Integrity</strong>: Putting honesty and ethics before any personal gain.</li><br/>

<p>These are the essential characteristics, my friends! No matter how many millions of dollars in sales
an agent had last year—or whether they were the top realtor in their office, won all kinds of sales
awards, promised to work hard for you, or even if they look like Brad Pitt or Angelina Jolie—none of
these qualities make them a great realtor! Remember, with commitment, communication, ambition, and
integrity, you can’t go wrong!</p>

<div class="flex-rectangle">
<H2>CHILL PILL #3</H2>
<p>Vet your realtor! This is one of the biggest purchases you’ll make in your lifetime. It’s
important that the person representing you is qualified and experienced enough to do the job
effectively. You deserve the best, so make sure you hire the best.</p>
</div>

<p>Sadly, after the housing crisis of 2007 to 2009 consumer confidence hit an all-time low. Anyone
working in any aspect of the real estate business was perceived to be culpable for the disaster. But,
the truth is, real estate agents had nothing to do with the bottom falling out of the market.</p>
<p>Nowadays, because of the uncertainty about who can be trusted, many buyers think they’re doing
themselves a favor if they avoid sticking to one real estate agent. Instead, they bounce around to
multiple agents or simply go off on their own to try to find a house to buy. They scour the internet or
drive around neighborhoods, which is both time consuming and not the most efficient way to go about
finding the best property to suit your needs and desires.</p>
<p>Let me give you some direction on the process of finding an excellent real estate agent, rather than
choosing the  agent whose  name  and  picture  were  on a  sign that you passed  on a  random street.
(Believe it or not, some people actually do this!)</p><br/>

<li><p>Ask  a  friend or relative  who  has  recently moved.  If  they had  a  good  experience,
chances are they will gladly recommend their agent; if not, keep looking. Ask your friend what
they liked or did not like about the agent, if they are willing to tell you.</p></li>

<li><p> Look through websites for agents who have a lot of MLS listings. This could mean
they’re busy, and a busy agent is usually a good agent! By the way, MLS stands for Multiple
Listing Service. This is the online hub where realtors market properties for sale.</p></li>

<li><p>Find  a  neighborhood  specialist.  A  specialist  is  someone  who  specializes  in  the
communities  where  you want to  buy your  home.  Even if an agent can represent you from
another county, chances are that the agent who lives in the local market and sells in the local
market will be more familiar with the specifications of the properties that are bought and sold
within that district.</p></li>

<li><p>Attend  networking  events,  mixers,  and  lunch  meetings  held  by  the  chamber  of
commerce, which often have real estate agents in attendance. The fact that they took the time tobe there indicates an agent who is a go-getter and who will be active in trying to find you the
right property.</p></li>

<li><p>Ask the broker of record at a real estate agency for their best pick. A broker of record is
essentially the supervisor. Call and tell them you want their star player—ideally, a seasoned,
stellar  agent  who  is  patient  and  has  great  follow-through.  No  one  knows  their  agents’
performance better than the broker of record.</p></li>

<li><p>Conduct interviews with agents in your area. Then, request references and call them
just the same as you would if you were interviewing a potential employee.</p></li>

<li><p>Visit an open house at a home that interests you. Many great agents will arrange to show
a home on behalf of the homeowner, but it gives new buyers a chance to meet quality agents
who can also locate properties that are similar to the prospect’s requirements. Just make sure
you ask up front if they’re a “dual disclosed agent” or if they could represent you as a “buyer’s
agent” (more on this later in this chapter). This becomes important if you decide to make an
offer on the same house they are showcasing.</p></li>

<li><p> Call the local real estate board to find out if there have been any complaints against or
infractions on the agent you are considering. The board may even be able to recommend you to
some of the most respected agents in the area.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Most licensed real estate agents are honorable, ethical and worth their weight in gold, but
just  as  in  every  occupation,  you  have  professionals  who  work  at  different  performance  levels:
outstanding, good, average, or just plain bad. Poor performance can usually be attributed to a couple
of factors,  such as  inexperience,  lack of ambition or  understanding of their  customers’ needs,  or
simply lack of common sense to get the job done properly.</p>

<div class="flex-rectangle">
<H2>CHILL PILL #4</H2>
<p>As a rule of thumb, any well-respected agent will have plenty of references, a prominent
website, a lot of listings, and a good rapport with other agents and brokers. Many people don’t
realize that even if a property of interest to you is listed with another agent, your own personal
real estate agent can also show it to you. So no need to flip-flop with agents.</p>
</div>

<p>Both good and bad agents have one thing in common—their job is to be a “deal-maker.” Some
real estate agents will perform all sorts of tricks to “stitch up” a deal. This is fine, so long as they are
not “stitching up” the buyer or the seller. There’s nothing wrong with displaying enthusiasm to pull a
deal together. In fact, this should be applauded. However, your agent needs to remain professional
and ethical at all times throughout the process, from contract to closing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most homeowners are reasonably inexperienced when it comes to buying or selling
a property. They rely greatly on the perceived abilities of the agent they are dealing with. Many
homeowners are “fair game” for an inexperienced, disloyal, or dishonest agent!</p>
<p>In any negotiation, win–win deals are the best. Unfortunately, when buying or selling a house,
things sometimes happen to benefit just one party . . . the buyer, the seller, or possibly just the real
estate agent. Therein lies the danger. Who is the real estate agent really working for? Where do their
true loyalties lie? With the seller, the buyer, or themselves? And how is one to know the difference
before it is too late?</p>
<p>It’s important to understand that a real estate agent can be working as a buyer’s agent, a seller’s
agent, or a dual disclosed agent. Let’s go over what these mean:</p>

<ul>
<li>
  <p><strong>Buyer’s Agent</strong>: An agent whose fiduciary responsibility is with the buyer. They work
solely with the buyer to represent their best interests in a real estate transaction.</p></li>

<li>
  <p> <strong>Seller’s Agent</strong>: An agent whose fiduciary responsibility is with the seller. They work
solely with the seller to represent their best interests in a real estate transaction. A seller’s agent
is the same as a “listing agent.” The two terms are used interchangeably.</p></li>

<li>
  <p><strong>Dual Disclosed Agent</strong>: An agent who represents both the buyer and seller in a real estate
transaction. They must disclose their role to both and have written permission from both parties
to proceed.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Dual disclosed agency can be very helpful and efficient if you are dealing with an ethical agent. It
means that you have one agent overseeing the deal, so it’s in their best interest to ensure that all goes
well and that the deal closes. It’s a win-win for the agent, because it means they’ll get to keep both
sides  of the  commission.  Normally the  buyer’s  and  seller’s  agents  split the  sales  commission atclosing, but if one agent represents both parties, they get to keep the entire commission.</p>
<p>Herein also lies the trouble, because keeping the whole commission is an enticing proposition for
any agent. It can also be a trick-bag for the clients of an unethical agent.</p>
<p>I  remember  a  scandalous  transaction that  took place  a  few  years  ago:  A lovely couple  had
narrowed down their prospects to two homes they really loved. One house was being listed by their
agent, which meant he was acting as a dual agent on that one, and the house they were really leaning
toward  was  being represented  by Agent X.  Ultimately the  couple  placed  an offer  on Agent X’s
property. Twenty-four hours later the couple received the very unpleasant news that someone else
beat them to it, and the seller had taken the offer. Disappointed, the couple then placed an offer on
their second choice, the property their agent listed. Well, lo and behold, eleven days before closing,
the husband decided to surf the internet just to look at more homes.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t  you know  it:  The  home  they were  initially in love  with was  still  listed  for  sale.
Confused,  the  husband  called  their  agent,  but  got  voicemail.  Then he  noticed  the  listing agent’s
number on a photo next to the house, so he called and inquired about the property. He was dumbstruck
to find out that not only was the property still for sale, but it was also listed with a price reduction.
His  agent had  never  presented  his  offer.  Unbelievable! They took the  matter  up  with the  agent’s
managing broker  and  with the  local  Real  Estate  Commission—and  rightfully so.  Ultimately,  the
crooked agent lost his license to sell real estate.</p>
<p>Again, this type of activity is not the norm, but it does happen. Just don’t let it happen to you.
Nine times out of ten there is nothing wrong with a “dual disclosed agent” relationship so long as
your agent remains ethical and you feel assured that they will work in your best interest.</p>
<p>If you ever feel that your setup has taken a sticky turn, simply go to your agent’s managing broker
and request that they assign another agent to represent your side of the deal. If you do it this way, your
agent shouldn’t get too wrinkled about it; at least they still get to keep some of the commission as a
referral.</p>

  <h2>HOW STICKING WITH ONE AGENT WORKS IN YOUR FAVOR</h2>

<p>This brings me to the many reasons why you should stick with your real estate agent after you have
found the right one.</p>
<p>So you want me to be loyal  to you, but you’re clearly noncommittal, eh? Sounds like you’re
talking to a new love prospect, right? Or maybe an ex? Whenever you are in a relationship, whether
romantic  or  professional,  a  connection  has  been  made.  The  relationship  that  exists  between
homebuyers and their real estate agents is no different than the relationship you would forge with your
minister, accountant, or barber. You get to know each other and even care about each other. Many of
my clients  become  people  I  care  about  a  great  deal,  and  I  truly enjoy making their  dreams  of
homeownership come true. Sometimes I get to work with them again a few years down the road and
see their children get taller. And I have to say that these clients are people I really go the extra mile to
help.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, homebuyers are reluctant to sign paperwork binding them to anything. Some of themwould rather “test the waters” and “sow their oats,” rather than settle down and “put a ring on it” by
committing to a real estate agent. Unfortunately, this can present problems for homebuyers and create
messy situations for all parties involved.</p>
<p>Why? Well, when a buyer selects one licensed real estate agent to represent them in the process of
buying a home, that agent accepts what is called a “fiduciary responsibility” to that particular buyer.
According to the National Association of Realtors (NAR), the six fiduciary duties of a realtor to
his or her client are loyalty, obedience, disclosure, confidentiality, reasonable care and diligence, and
accounting.</p>
<p>Obedience  means  obeying the  instructions  of the  client; reasonable  care  and diligence  means
using your skills as a real estate professional to the best of your abilities; and accounting means
accurate financial record keeping. The fiduciary duties of loyalty, disclosure, and confidentiality can
be a bit more complex.</p>
<p>Let me break them down for you:<br/>
  <strong>Loyalty</strong>. This refers to the manner in which a realtor must act at all times to serve the best
interests of the client, excluding all other interests. (i.e. the realtor’s own self-interests). This
includes avoiding any conflicts of interest that might compromise a realtor’s loyalty to her
client.</p>

<p><strong>Disclosure</strong>. The realtor must disclose any and all relevant information to the main client,
whether they are a buyer’s agent or a seller’s agent. According to the NAR, if an agent
represents the buyer, they must disclose:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Any knowledge of whether a seller is likely to settle for a lower price</li>
  <li>Any information regarding a seller’s need to sell a property</li>
  <li> Any legal or other relationship with a seller or a property for sale</li>
  <li>Any information regarding the value of a property</li>
  <li> The duration a property has been for sale</li>
  <li> A complete history of offers and counteroffers</li>
  <li> Any other information potentially impacting a buyer’s ability to buy a property at the
    lowest price and with the best terms</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Confidentiality</strong>. A realtor must keep the client’s confidence and secrets, much the same as a
doctor or someone in the legal profession. This is especially true of any information that could
compromise the client’s bargaining position. The responsibility to maintain confidentiality
means that a real estate agent representing a seller cannot disclose to a potential buyer that the
seller needs to sell the property urgently or will likely sell a property at a lower price. The
agent would then be violating the “covenant of trust.” On the flip side, a buyer’s agent cannot
disclose to a seller that the buyer will pay a higher price than the current offer.</p>

<p>Whew,  that was  a  lot of information! But it’s  probably clear  at this  point that working with
multiple agents instead of designating one agent is not in the buyer’s best interest. For one thing, it canlead to confusion—who, exactly, is loyal to whom? For another, if the buyer works with just one
agent, that agent is obligated to keep their best interests in mind as they work together. It’s a mutually
beneficial relationship.</p>
<p>Working with more than one agent can also be a turn-off to a seller and their real estate agent
because it sends a red flag to the seller’s side that this buyer could be troublesome to deal with. Not
to mention, it could potentially cause a legal dispute after closing. Determining which broker from the
buyer’s side is entitled to earn a real  estate commission check may not be clear; it may lead to
disputes and hassles that cause time delays.
In contrast, working exclusively with one agent:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Gives homebuyers the opportunity to build a strong rapport with an agent who can
      invest time in serving their needs during the buying process. And it connects buyers with a “go-
      to” guy or gal who has your back when it comes to buying a home, without having to worry
      whether the realtor is primarily serving yours or the seller’s needs. In other words, it takes away
      the question of motives.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Helps to prevent buyers from missing out on the chance of finding, bidding on, and buying
      the home of their dreams.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Gives you someone to ask for advice on other aspects of the homebuying process,
      especially if you are a first-time homebuyer or just new to the process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>    <p>Enables you to waste less time by having an agent work for you instead of trying to do all
      of the scouting, negotiating, and paperwork on your own.    </p></li>
</ul>
<p>Have faith in your real estate agent! If you’ve chosen someone with the qualities I mentioned
above, then you’re most likely in good hands. It is okay if you are not satisfied and want to find
someone else, but just be courteous enough to make the most respectable exit as possible.</p>
<p>To serve as an example, I once represented a newlywed couple that had saved up money for a
down payment for a couple of years toward the purchase of their first home. David and Elise were
smart people with great careers in media. Overall, they seemed like nice people who appeared to
have their priorities in order.</p>
<p>The couple had completed many of the “right” things in preparing to purchase their first home.</p>
<p>They even attended a regional first-time homebuyer’s seminar at their local community center and
eventually met with two local mortgage loan officers to compare interest rates and determine how
much they could afford to borrow. They asked family members who were homeowners for advice,
and this is precisely where things got tricky. Prior to meeting me, David and Elise had viewed a
couple of homes they liked, but both times they had made an offer, someone else beat them to the
punch and they were outbid by other buyers.</p>
<p>Despite being advised at the seminar to meet with at least two real estate agents and choose only
one that was a good fit for them to work with exclusively, this couple did the very opposite. Instead,they spent their weekends driving around through various neighborhoods of interest, hoping to find
their “dream starter house.”</p>
<p>Feeling discouraged by the results and with the homebuying process as a whole, they decided to
take a different and more aggressive approach. Upon the encouragement of unwitting relatives, they
planned to contact the listing agent directly and develop a rapport. The theory was that by working
directly with the listing agent, it would pretty much guarantee that the sellers would accept their offer.
This is a big misconception that many people have about the homebuying process. Just as in life,
nothing in realty is guaranteed.</p>
<p>As luck would have it, after searching for an exhausting nine months and hopping from agent to
agent with no luck, the couple was introduced to me. We instantly clicked, and after determining what
their homebuying needs were, I found them a home they really liked.</p>
<p>It was a charming, three-bedroom Cape Cod situated on a nice quarter-acre plot. It had a ton of
potential, but needed some sprucing up. It piqued their interest because of its proximity to a nearby
beach town that  they enjoyed  going to  as  well  as  the  convenience  of  public  transportation into
Manhattan and affordable property taxes. However, the lack of upgrades was a bit of a downer for
them, so after seeing it a second time, they decided to keep searching.</p>
<p>A month later, I got word that some updates were done to the home. But unfortunately I was out of
town and returning in two days. It was the only weekend I took off the whole month! So I called
David and Elise and asked them to drive by and take a look at the new exterior. I offered to schedule
an appointment for them to view it on the day I returned if they were interested. The exterior was
almost unrecognizable compared to what they’d seen before. The homeowner had installed a new
stucco facade, new windows, a new fence, and lush new landscaping.</p>
<p>The listing agent happened to be hosting an open house that day, so it gave David and Elise a
chance to go inside again for the third time, without scheduling an appointment to view it. Again, they
were not accompanied by the agent they had been working with for the past few months . . . Namely,
ME.</p>
<p>Upon entering the home, they were greeted with and asked to fill out their contact info on the sign-
in sheet. One of the questions asked on the questionnaire was whether they were working with an
agent and, if so, to please state the agent’s name and contact info. Instead of following the instructions,
the newlyweds checked the box that read “not currently represented by an agent.”
The listing agent eagerly showed them around the home. David and Elise called her that very
same night and made an offer.</p>
<p>The agent reminded the pair that by working with her directly to purchase the home, she would be
taking on the role of a “disclosed dual agent.” Again, a “dual disclosed agent” is someone who works
with both the buyer and the seller in a neutral fashion with no allegiance to one side or another. In
many states, “dual  agency” is perfectly legal  and works fine between both sides of a real  estate
transaction. But it doesn’t guarantee the best results for either buyer or seller.</p>
<p>The morning after the offer was made, I happened to call Elise to see if she and David had taken a
look at the exterior upgrades. I also wanted to confirm our appointment to re-tour the home. I did not
hear back from her. I tried again during her lunch break the next day, not knowing they had placed an
offer. This time, she picked up.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the conversation took a turn when Elise informed me that she and David had
already written an offer on the house the day before, without informing me. I felt like I had been hitwith a sledgehammer! I was stunned, upset, and totally confused by their actions. I had held them in
such high regard, and thought we had established an excellent rapport. At that point, I asked Elise to
set up a conference call with her husband so that we could all be on the same page.</p>
<p>Much to my surprise and disappointment, David became very dismissive and essentially blew off
the fact that I had introduced them to the house, arranged two showings, and notified them of the
upgrades. I explained that the way they went about things wasn’t the proper way to buy a house. I
wasn’t looking to hold any grudges against them. They were very inexperienced as homebuyers, so I
chalked it up to their rookie status.</p>
<p>When I suggested  that we  resolve  the  matter  ethically,  the  husband  countered  that he  had  no
obligation to disclose our pre-existing relationship with the seller’s agent. I certainly couldn’t twist
his arm or force him to do what was right, but I did have a signed buyer’s agency agreement, and an
ethical obligation to disclose our pre-existing relationship to the listing agent. The way things work in
the real estate business is that the agent who is the “procuring cause” of a client being introduced to a
home is the one entitled to the commission, or in some cases partial commission.</p>

<div class="flex-rectangle">
<H2>CHILL PILL #5</H2>
<p>Unless your agent has done something truly horrible or unethical, it is considered unacceptable
and in poor taste to exclude them from participating in the offer you make on a property they
found on your behalf.</p>
</div>

<p>So I called the seller’s agent to let her know that I had shown them the home twice before the
upgrades were completed. I didn’t want to get in the middle of a dispute, but frankly, if I hadn’t
shared this information with the listing agent, we could have all potentially wound up in court over
something  that  was  clearly  avoidable.  The  real  estate  business  is  a  close-knit  community,  and
dishonesty always comes back to bite you.</p>
<p>Soon after our conversation, the agent called David and Elise to tell them that the sellers had
accepted another offer that had been submitted by a different agent. In this case, perhaps the buyers’
dishonesty—intentional or not—had something to do with the fact that their offer was not accepted by
the sellers. In any case, they didn’t end up with the home of their dreams.</p>
<p>The lesson here is this: When you exclude someone who has been working diligently for you and
spending  their  time  and  resources  to  help  you,  it  is  dishonest  to  leave  that  person  out  of  the
transaction.  Not  only  could  this  result  in  ill  feelings  or  an  undesirable  outcome,  as  with  the
newlyweds, but it could also result in a lawsuit or legal hassles.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, <em>“Honesty is always the best policy!”</em> It’s true for both sides. </p>

  <h2>THE TRICK TO CUTTING THE FAT IN YOUR HOME SEARCH</h2>

<p>As I mentioned in the chapter about choosing an agent, if you find a very competent and experienced
realtor, then your search should not take long. He or she can narrow down your criteria with very
little effort and can also give you the best advice as to which properties offer the best value to you as
a homebuyer.</p>
<p>According to national statistics, the average buyer sees twelve homes before making a purchase.
Of course, there are those who see more and those who see less. Every now and again I run into
buyers  who  want  to  see  everything  on  the  market  before  making  a  decision.  I  mean  literally
everything. Please don’t be that kind of buyer. Nothing will make an agent run away from you fasterthan acting like a kid in a candy store.</p>
<p>In my entire real estate career, I’ve only had to fire one client. Yes, real estate agents can fire you
as well! Jessie was a thirty-four year old bachelorette from Bergen County, New Jersey. She had an
ideal profile as a homebuyer. Her credit score was 780; she’d been at her job for more than six years,
and she had a sizable down payment. There were no immediate red flags.</p>
<p>I asked her to come up with a wish list, which is something I do with each of my clients to help
them narrow  down their  choices.  Jessie  wanted a  three-bedroom townhome  in a  swimming-pool
community  with  low  HOA  fees,  new  appliances,  and  new  or  updated  features  throughout.  She
preferred move-in ready, but she absolutely did not want to live within a few block’s radius of a
school because of the noise. So far so good, right?</p>
<p>On the first day of our home tour I explained to Jessie that we would be seeing five homes per day
so that she could retain the information. She was appalled and demanded to see more. Her reasoning
was that she got very little time off of work and needed to make the most of it. To accommodate her
request, I suggested we fit in one or two more, which was against my better judgment. Her response
was that she’d be happier with seeing ten or twelve that day. How absurd! As a thorough agent, I
make it my business to preview all homes that my clients visit so that I can ensure their time is not
wasted. This also helps to narrow down the homes they need to see before making an offer. It saves
everyone time and energy. Ten to twelve was just not necessary in one day.</p>
<p>After a week of home searching, Jessie came to my office without a scheduled appointment with a
handful of listings she found online and wanted to see that day. Many of them were far out of her price
range and search criteria. I explained to her that I had three other clients that day, but could preview
some of the houses by the next day and show her a few. The next day, I sorted out five of the twenty-
five homes she brought me based on those that suited her wish list. My client was visibly angry that
she  could  not  see  all  of  them that  day.  I  explained  to  her  that  she  requested  a  three  bedroom
townhome, and some of the listings were for five bedroom single family homes that were almost
$100,000 over her budget. She also mentioned that she didn’t want to live near schools because of the
noise. Well, two of the homes were on the same block as a firehouse and one was literally across the
park from an elementary school. She even included condominiums in buildings with HOA fees that
were  over  $1,200  per  month.  It  was  the  complete  opposite  of  everything she  said  she  wanted.</p>
<p>Confused, I asked if she was changing her mind on her initial wish list, and her answer was, “No, I
still really want a townhouse.” I advised her that most of the listings she requested to see were far out
of her search criteria and budget. Her response? “That may be true, but I still want to at least see
them.” Clearly she wasn’t getting the concept of a wish list or search criteria.</p>
<p>After two months of working with Jessie, I decided to gracefully bow out. Her search could have
lasted more than a year and probably did. She wasn’t being fair or realistic to me, or to herself. It
was a lose-lose situation.</p>
<p>When discussing your needs with your agent, be detailed. The more information they are armed
with, the more they can help you. At the very beginning of your search, write down everything you
absolutely want in your home, everything you absolutely don’t want, and a list of things you are
willing to compromise on. If you are searching with a partner, it’s important that you do this both
individually and also together.<br/>
Here are some things to think about when creating your wish list:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Style of home</strong>: Single-family, townhouse, condo?</li>
  <li><strong>Price range</strong>: What is your comfort zone? What’s the absolute highest you can go for a home you love?</li>
  <li> <strong>Taxes:</strong> What’s the most you want to pay?</li>
  <li><strong> Location</strong>: Where are your top three areas to live?</li>
  <li> <strong>Distance</strong>: How far to work, friends, family?</li>
  <li><strong> Amenities</strong>: Swimming, tennis, clubhouse, gated?</li>
  <li> <strong>Square footage</strong>: How large or small?</li>
  <li> <strong>Number of beds and baths</strong>: Three or four? More?</li>
  <li> <strong>Flooring</strong>: Hardwood, carpet, tile?</li>
  <li> <strong>Age of home</strong>: Newer or older?</li>
  <li> <strong>Condition</strong>: Move-in ready or in need ofupdates?</li>
  <li> <strong>Parking:</strong> Driveway, garage, or carport?</li>
  <li> <strong>Outdoor space:</strong> Backyard, fenced-in, deck, garden?</li>
  <li> <strong>Neighborhood</strong>: Near schools, shopping, residential, urban? What about diversity? Or lack ofdiversity?</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you’ve crafted your wish list, the key is to stick to it! This ensures you’ll have a successful
search and be happy with your purchase in the end. Now, we do have an offbeat saying in our field
that “buyers are liars.” LOLOL! This is often because buyers tend to start out adamant about what is
“non-negotiable” for them. But by the end of the process they’ve eventually done a complete one-

  <h2>WHY YOU SHOULD LOOK UNDER THE HOOD BEFORE MAKING AN OFFER</h2>

<p>You wouldn’t buy a used car without looking under the hood, so why would you buy a home without
checking it over thoroughly? Find out as much as possible about the history of the home. How many
owners have lived in it? Was it a rental or owner-occupied prior to being put on the market? When
were the latest renovations made? What types of home improvements have been made? How recently
were they done?</p>
<p>Every  home  has  a  backstory.  Normally  the  MLS  (Multiple  Listing  System)  offers  limited
information about the home. Depending on the MLS system (they vary from state to state), you can
usually find the price paid by the current homeowner, when they bought it, and any price reductions.</p>
<p>To get accurate and up-to-date information about property taxes, you’ll need to research the county tax
records. To learn whether there were ever any fires or floods, you may want to pay a visit to the local
fire department or to the county clerk’s office. This information is available to you with very little
digging—most of it can be found on the Internet. A great agent will research this for you without
having to be asked. But making sure this is being done may behoove you! It’s much the same as
requesting a “Carfax” report on a used vehicle. You don’t want to get stuck with a lemon.</p>
<p>Next, evaluate other considerations, like the neighborhood and even the neighbors who live on
each side of you. While this may not be a deal breaker, it’s important to know if you will like living
there. You are buying more than just the house. You are buying the neighborhood and everyone in it.
</p>
<p>Take a walk around the block. Do families live in the neighborhood? Mostly old or young? Single
or with children? Are there any dangerous dogs? Do you feel like you have anything in common with
the neighbors? Do they seem welcoming and friendly, or disinterested? Does this even matter to you?
</p>
<p>If you have children, consider the school district. If public schools rank low in that particular
area, do you have other options available, such as private schools? This factor can affect resale.
</p>
<p>Is the community in support of the neighborhood’s rebirth and development? Finding a home in an
up-and-coming neighborhood could mean that your home will increase in value over the next five to
ten years, but buying a home in a declining market could leave you upside down if you ever want to
sell.  You  can  find  out  about  any  short-and  long-term development  by  contacting  the  community
planning and development department for the municipality. Every town has a department such as this.They are responsible for coordinating the long-range planning for each town.</p>

<p>In my opinion, location is the most important thing you should be mindful of when shopping for
real estate. I’ve seen it happen dozens of times: A client falls head over heels in love with a house
without fully considering the neighborhood. They buy the house, move in . . . and then they meet the
crazy neighbors. Think about it. If you have a nice house in a crummy neighborhood, then you may not
be happy and could even be risking your safety. Most people do their grocery shopping, participate in
lifestyle  events,  and  run  errands  within  a  mile  of  their  home.  So  it’s  important  that  you  feel
comfortable within your chosen community.</p>

<div class="flex-rectangle"><h2>CHILL PILL #7</h2>
<p>If you feel strongly about a home you have previewed, go back and visit it again prior to
making an offer. You may see things that you missed in the first tour, especially if you have
visited a number of properties.</p></div>

<p>Don’t forget the example of the Natasha, the Boston buyer, whom I mentioned in the introduction.
Those railroad tracks can be misleading! Had Natasha done her homework, she would have known
that the train ran by at least two or three times each hour, rather than two or three times per day. That’s
a big difference!</p>
<p>So take time and do your homework. Observe the surrounding landscape. Is there anything loud or
undesirable nearby? Are there any factories, loud highways, or high-traffic scenarios? For instance,
people who live near schools may be detained for a couple of hours every afternoon while waiting
for the kids to be picked up or bussed home. Is there anything about the community that you don’t like,
but that may end up being a small sacrifice because you like everything else?</p>
<p>Location is critical, friends! Quality of life is the reason to buy in the first place, so make sure you
choose something that is comfortable and inviting. Of course, you can’t control future circumstances
like having a neighbor move in next door who has the world’s largest hubcap collection. For now, if
everything looks  great,  then you have  to  assess  whether  the  quality of  life  is  in line  with your
individual preferences, likes, lifestyle, and comfort zone.</p>

  <h2>SMART TIPS FOR BUYING IN AN HOA OR GATED COMMUNITY</h2>

<p>In many states across the country, you will find an abbreviation next to certain homes listed on the
MLS that says, “HOA Community,” particularly in subdivisions, gated communities or in clusters of
townhomes. What does this mean?</p>
<p>HOA stands for Homeowners Association, which is an organization that oversees the properties
within a particular development, district, or specific area in which the home is located. Sometimes
there are less than a hundred of these homes in one neighborhood, while other times you will find
hundreds of homes within a development or area.</p>
<p>The job of the HOA is to oversee and enforce the rules of the community and maintain the integrity
of the homes within it. In some communities the HOA covers all of the landscaping services, garbage
pickup, and maintainance of common areas like the pool or clubhouse.</p>
<p>In HOA communities there are often guidelines to follow when keeping pets on a leash or picking
up after them. I don’t know about you, but I find it offensive when a neighbor lets their pooch lay
down a fresh one on my sidewalk! This rarely happens in a community with an HOA.</p>
<p>The HOA typically collects a fee from members, so if you happen to buy a home within one ofthese communities you will have additional monthly or yearly dues to pay on top of your monthly
mortgage payment. Make sure you factor this in, just the same as you would put your utility bills or
car payment within your monthly budget.</p>
<p>On the “pro” side of living in an HOA community (which can be either gated or not gated, by the
way), you will most likely have more amenities and conveniences. For example, a lot of communities
have a fitness center, pool, banquet facilities for you to host a party, and the landscaping will be
beautifully managed for you without having to spend money on a landscaper. This can be a good way
to look at the extra expense of the HOA dues in that you may end up saving money on something else.</p>
<p>Other communities have bike paths, gyms for volleyball or racquetball games, billiards tables,
and car ports or individual garages for members. Every community is different, so the amenities that
you will find will vary from one place to the next . . . but so do the rules!
The  rules  can  sometimes  be  a  turnoff,  especially  for  those  people  who  are  used  to  having
flexibility. If you like to park your boat or your ’66 Corvette with a cover in your driveway for an
extended period of time, then a home in an HOA community is probably not for you.</p>
<p>HOA communities can be strict. If you leave your garbage can out for an extra day because you
forgot to carry it back from the curb, you might be at risk of getting a warning or even a fine from the
HOA. These are some of the drawbacks that you should be aware of.</p>
<p>Another complaint of residents is that HOAs are less “people-oriented” and are all business; they
may be less responsive to a homeowner’s needs. If you have a complaint to take up with the HOA or
you want an exception to the rules, the association may need to have a special meeting. You could end
up having to wait a long time for your concern to be taken care of. This totally depends on the size
and responsiveness of the HOA, two factors you should investigate prior to actually purchasing a
home.</p>

<div class="flex-rectangle"><h2>CHILL PILL #8</h2>
<p>Before you buy in a community with an HOA, get a “bylaw” book and read every rule listed to
see if the property is going to be a good fit for your desires, needs, and the freedoms you
currently enjoy. You may like the extra attention and community atmosphere of living in an
HOA community, or you may find the rules too rigid for your taste.</p></div>

<p>Keep in mind that the HOA might need to “approve” you as a resident or tenant of that community.
Their job is to keep the neighborhood safe, so if you like to participate in any questionable activities
or do things that are outside of the “norm,” a community with an HOA may not be a good fit for you.</p>
<p>For instance, I know a guy who bought a townhouse in an HOA community and was told that each
property owner was required to give the HOA access to each residence in the community once every
six months for a smoke detector test. Their rationale was that if one of the townhomes caught fire, then
all of the houses on that block would also be at risk. Even though this seemed like a pretty reasonable
rule, he was the “rebellious” type who refused to abide by the rules and let the HOA come into his
home.</p>
<p>Eventually, the HOA took the homeowner to court. It cost him a lot of money to hire a lawyer, and
he lost the case. It was clearly written in the bylaws before he bought the house. Even though it was
his home, he was out of line and not compliant. After losing and spending a lot of time and money in
legal hassles, he was ordered by the court to allow the HOA in bi-annually for the smoke detector
test. He also had to pay their legal fees in addition to his own.</p>
<p>Now, I want to be clear: Millions of people buy homes in HOA communities and are very happy.
It is professional, usually very orderly, and safe. Despite the ground rules, there are always those few
people who think that living in an HOA community is no different from any other neighborhood, and
because they “own” their home, they should be allowed to do whatever they want on the grounds of
their own property. This is a valid argument, and I can see both sides; therefore, I make it a point to
find out what my clients expect before showing any homes in communities with an HOA.</p>
<p>I once had a gentleman who bought his house and then a few months later, wanted to break ground
on a new swimming pool in his backyard. Unfortunately, it was against the HOA policies! Boy, he
was as mad as a hornet after you pick the flower it was just about to land on! I had to remind him that
he was given the HOA bylaws in advance and neglected to read them.</p>

<h3>CONSIDER THESE SEVEN THINGS WHEN CONSIDERING A HOME IN AN HOA COMMUNITY:</h3>

<div data-role="collapsible-set">
  <div data-role="collapsible">
    <h3>Fees</h3>
    <p>How much are the fees for the residents? They could be anywhere between $50
and $1,000 or more per month, depending on the affluence of the neighborhood, how many
other homes share the HOA dues (distribution of fees), and what those fees generally cover.Most often, they include the maintenance of all common areas, including property landscaping,
the clubhouse, playground, and pool.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
    <h3>Rules</h3>
    <p>Are the covenants (bylaws) too strict for your taste? Or are they something you
can live with? For example, in some HOA divisions there may be rules about what color your
house must be, right down to the shutter colors, railing, and front door. There may be rules
about what you can park in your own driveway or even what window treatments you can use.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
    <h3>Quality of Management</h3>
    <p>There are HOAs that are known to be too strict and over-
managed, where the least infraction can cost you a hefty fine. Then there are those that are
under-managed,  where  no  one  seems  to  give  a  hoot about the  cracks  in the  sidewalks  or
shingles falling off the roofs, leaving properties looking less than desirable.</p></div>
	
	<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
    <h3>Pet Policies</h3>
    <p>Be aware that some dog breeds may be restricted (particularly larger or more
aggressive breeds). Other rules regarding pets often apply, especially regarding poop pickup
duties, dog bites, and leaving a dog outside. Even if you don’t have a pet, read this rule just in
case one day you change your mind and want to know the rules about what you can and can’t
do.</p></div>
	
	<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
    <h3>Impact  on  Your  Monthly  Budget</h3>
    <p>Do  the  extra  HOA  dues  put  your  mortgage
calculations over budget? If you have to adjust to accommodate HOA fees, then your new
house could become a financial disaster.</p></div>
	
	<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
    <h3>Drama</h3>
    <p>Dig a little deeper into the “feeling” of the community. Ask your realtor to get a
copy of the last HOA meeting transcript to find out any past or current conflicts that exist
between members of the community. The last thing you want to do is put yourself in the midst
of drama! You can find out if any lawsuits exist or if only certain neighbors have complained.
If you’re lucky, this will be a peaceful community that is well managed.</p></div>
	
	<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
    <h3>Past problems</h3>
    <p>Is the home you want to buy currently in compliance with the HOA? The
last thing you want to do is take over someone else’s previous headache, so see if you can get a
home history and determine whether any prior issues exist.</p>
  </div>
</div>


<p>Under no circumstance do I wish to deter you from buying in an HOA community if that is the right
choice for you and your family. However, if you are someone who dislikes rules or who doesn’t like
to be told what to do, then perhaps your personality might not be the best fit and you should consider
buying elsewhere.</p>

  <h2>THE REAL DEAL WITH SHORT SALES & FORECLOSURES</h2>

<p>Many people set their minds on buying a foreclosure simply because they’ve heard rumors about
steals on price. They erroneously believe they will get a better deal than if they purchase a home on
the regular market.</p>
<p>Historically,  foreclosures  have  been  equitable  for  skilled  buyers.  The  trouble  is  that  the
foreclosure secret is no longer a secret, and in many cities, there is a lot of competition when bidding
at auctions for the small inventory of worthwhile foreclosures out there. I’m sure you don’t need me
to illustrate for you what happens when bidding starts to heat up, do you? That’s right; it drives the
price up, many times to market value. So is it really that good of a deal in the end?</p>
<p>Buying distressed property is  not for  everyone, and there  are  many factors  to consider  when
buying a foreclosure. For example, when a bank takes over a property from a homeowner in default,
the house is often in need of major repairs. The homeowner has been in financial crisis and perhaps
unable to stay on top of maintenance. The need for roof repairs, old appliances, floor and ceiling
replacements, and even electrical rewiring are not uncommon in foreclosures and bank takeovers.</p>
<p>Some homeowners even deliberately ruin the home or in some cases, have moved away from the
area with nobody there to maintain it. This can lead to other problems, such as unwanted critters,
vandalism, missing fixtures, and other strange and unforeseen problems.</p>
<p>In many cases, you may not even get to see the inside of a foreclosed property. If the owners still
inhabit the place or if the bank is located in another state or the home is tied up in legal matters, this
makes presenting the house to the general public for viewing very difficult.</p>
<p>The other challenge with foreclosures is that there may be liens on the property due to the owner’s
failure to keep up with taxes, insurance, and other matters. Therefore, the town or municipality has a
right to  place  a  lien on the  house  and  land,  which requires  extra  paperwork and  hassle  for  the
eventual buyer.</p>
<p>Another reason not to get your hopes up about buying a short sale or foreclosure is that, much like
my lovely couple,  you will  be  competing with experienced  investors,  many of whom have  deep
pockets. You may not even have a chance to compete. Many of these professional home shoppers are
in a financial position to seal cash offers, which banks love when they want to unload a property. Thatdoesn’t mean the bank would snub its nose at any offer; however, your traditional 20 percent down—
as well as the hassle of sorting out the mortgage paperwork—may not be as appealing to the bank as
finding a buyer who is able to free them of their burden with cash.</p>
<p>Another complication to consider with distressed properties is whether the battle between the
bank and the homeowner is still pending, which could make it difficult for you to evict the occupants
from the house. Some desperate homeowners rent their place out in hopes of obtaining any kind of
income to pay the mortgage company and other bills. So if a third-party tenant is living in the home
and has signed a lease with the homeowner, and the homeowner has defaulted on the loan, this could
also be potentially nightmarish. Unfortunately, these are common scenarios.</p>
<p>Since the real estate bubble burst in 2007, there have been upwards of 2.2 million short sales.
Many owners were upside down on their properties and decided to sell them in a short sale, meaning
an approximate 10 to 20 percent discount for buyers. In 2007 and 2008, short sales seemed like an
interesting  prospect.  The  banks   were  short-staffed  in  their   loss   mitigation  departments   and
overloaded with short sales. Often, they were happy just to get an offer. Since the restructuring of the
banks, however, most are no longer letting go of their short sale properties at such deep discounts.</p>
<p>The other challenge with short sales can be hearing back from the bank in a reasonable amount of
time. When buying both short sales and foreclosures, you are at the mercy of the bank. Depending on
the person handling the case, the process can move at a decent pace, or it can move at a snail’s pace.</p>
<p>I’ve seen some short sales take up to six months, and I’ve seen some close in less than thirty days.</p>
<p>If you do find a foreclosure or short sale to buy, make sure you find out whether title problems or
unpaid taxes exist that might delay your closing. These seemingly small details can add up to one
giant frustration!</p>
<p>If you do want to proceed with a distressed property, there are a few things you need to know.</p>
<p>First, you will have to do a lot of research and due diligence. Your real agent can help with that. The
inspection, of course, is mandatory in my opinion under these circumstances, because you really need
to make sure the electrical, plumbing, roof, etc., are up to livable standards. We’ll talk more about the
importance of a home inspection in <a href="#ch8">Chapter 8</a>.</p>
<p>If  the  inspection  comes  back  with  a  list  of  thousands  of  dollars  in  recommended  repairs,
renovations, and home updates, you should consider getting some accurate and competitive quotes
from reputable contractors. And if the repairs cost more than what you would save buying a home that
is move-in ready, then you must truly ask yourself if buying the house is even worth it.</p>
<p>This also applies to tax liens. If the amount owed in back taxes is a lot higher than what you
would pay for a clear title and deed, there again, this is really not the best idea for you.</p>
<p>Best-case scenario: you successfully find a short sale or foreclosure that is practically a steal and
you need to invest very little money to fix up. Kudos to you if you find one of these gems at a great
price! Though it’s rarer these days, it does happen.</p>

  <h2>THE ABC’S OF REAL ESTATE SUPPLY & DEMAND, AND WHAT THEY MEAN FOR YOU</h2>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, the real estate market goes through cycles of highs and lows. I suppose it’s a
lot like other industries that coincide with the economy, except that the real estate market is also one
of the main predictors of the economy. Apart from Wall Street, I don’t think there is a more critical
indicator that determines how analysts, economists, financial planners, and the entire business world
maps the rise or decline of the economy.</p>
<p>One phenomenon that drives the highs and lows of the housing market—and that can affect you as
a  potential  buyer—is  a  shortage  in available  homes.  Inventory shortage  is  when there  are  more
people who want to buy or rent a home than there are homes available in the marketplace. The homes
that are vacant may be held off the market for a number of reasons. For example, during a time of
heavy  foreclosures  when  you  would  imagine  there  are  plenty  of  vacant  homes,  it  still  seems
impossible to find the right one at the right price. The empty homes may not be listed or available on
the  MLS  because  they need  repairs  or  because  they are  tied  up  in legal  issues,  or  even due  to
investors or banks waiting to put them up for rent or sale.</p>
<p>During an inventory shortage, both buyers and renters have fewer choices of available homes.
This can create a spike in both purchase and rental prices. Often, an inventory shortage can make it a
“sellers’  market,”  meaning  that  sellers  sell  high  and  buyers  have  less  negotiating  power.  Less
flexibility makes it tempting to overpay, especially if you get involved in a bidding war for a home
you really want and there are multiple offers on the table.</p>
<p>But there is a notable difference between inventory shortages and housing shortages. A housing
shortage happens when there are simply not enough homes available—a major problem whenever it
occurs. An inventory shortage, on the other hand, means there are plenty of vacant homes out there but
they are not for sale or rent. How can the houses for sale be low in number when the vacancy rate is
high? Again . . . the houses are not being presented to consumers, which in fact is a current problem at
the time of this app’s release. This can happen when banks or other institutions own a large number
of properties and have not yet put them on the market. We’ve seen this happen time and time again
over the past few years due to high owner default rates.</p>
<p>The US census is the best place to research these trends so that buyers and renters don’t overpay.
For example, between 2012 and the end of 2013, many homes in need of repair were being “prepped”
before they were placed on the market. This could be due to the many foreclosures caused by the
housing bubble of 2006 to 2007, when house prices were at an all-time high and mortgage companies
were lending to underqualified homebuyers.</p>
<p>After the housing bubble burst, the banks became a lot more cautious in who they lent to, and it
became even more difficult to get a loan for a home. As we will talk about in the upcoming chapter on
financing, the banks now only lend to people who meet the right criteria and who have a substantial
down payment, savings account, and steady flow of income.</p>
<p>Just like other trends, a real estate inventory shortage doesn’t last forever. The homes that are
being prepared for sale or rent will eventually become available. After these homes are added to the
current inventory, it will gradually level the crazy spikes in rental prices or asking prices, and will
turn it once again into a buyers’ market instead of a sellers’ market.</p>
<p>The real estate market goes up and down like a yo-yo. If you look at history, this has been going
on since the beginning of the twentieth century. Depressions in the economy don’t last. So, don’t get
depressed if you can’t find the house of your dreams at the price you want to pay today! Just wait until
the time is right, and I promise you that everything will fall into place naturally for you and with lesseffort than if you try to force it.</p>
<p>Sometimes I have clients who ask, “Well, if there aren’t enough homes available to buy or rent,
why don’t they build more?”
That is a great question! The simple answer is that construction companies are typically hesitant
to build new houses when there are many vacant homes sitting. Builders have suffered the crushing
side  effects  of the  housing industry bubble.  It is  also  more  difficult for  new  builders  to  emerge
because  of  the  lengths  they  must  go  through  to  obtain  the  appropriate  financing,  licensing,  and
insurance.</p>
<p>Do you remember not so long ago when we were reading about people who lost their entire life
savings to these con artists who presented themselves as “building contractors” but were instead fly-
by-night  companies  that  did  shoddy  work?  The  industry  adjusted  to  get  rid  of  these  supposed
contractors  by making it more difficult for  someone to get a license and insurance as  a building
contractor. This was actually a game changer and a good thing for the industry because it gave the
legitimate builders more staying power and credibility.</p>

  <h2>EIGHT SUREFIRE WAYS TO FIND YOUR DREAM HOME, EVEN
DURING AN INVENTORY SHORTAGE</h2>
<p>I know you love lists, so I’ve made this list of eight ways you can still find your dream house during
an inventory shortage.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Find a “Make Me Move” Listing. What is this? Homeowners now have an option to
post a price they would entertain to move from their house, without actually placing it on the
market. This is a cool concept that enables a seller to post a price they would accept if you
were  willing  to  pay  it,  which  is  great  if  you  are  shopping  for  a  house  in  a  particular
neighborhood or school district and can’t seem to find anything suitable. Google “Make Me
Move,” and you will find this as the first listing if you want to give it a try.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask Your Realtor About Pocket Listings. Your real estate agent usually has access to
listings that are not publicly advertised or that do not have signage. Although this is not the
case with every market, in heavily populated metropolitan areas or luxury markets, there are
sellers who don’t want to publicly advertise and would rather sell privately. Real estate agents
network with each other to find buyers for those sellers who wish to remain anonymous.</p></li>
<li><p>Find  “Pre-Market  Listings”  Before  They  Hit  the  MLS.  If  you  are  working  with  an
experienced agent and not a rookie, then most of the best real  estate firms have access to
forthcoming listings a few weeks ahead of time. If your agent is in the know, then he or she can
beat the general public to the punch by having access to these pre-listings that can’t be found
elsewhere.</p></li>

<li><p> Scour Rental Properties. A lot of homeowners got in a bind when they overpaid for a
house during the housing boom, making it tough for them to sell due to being “upside down,”
which means they owe more on the house than what it is actually worth. So their solution was
to rent it for a few years. In other cases, the owner may have had to move away and couldn’t
find a buyer fast enough to make the transition to a new place. So instead of putting it up for
sale, they decided to rent it for a few years. If the house is now vacant and available for rent
again, it can’t hurt to ask the current owner if they have any interest in selling. Or maybe they’ll
be interested in selling once the current renter’s lease is up. Perhaps they are tired of being
landlords, especially if they’re managing the property from a distance. Your offer might be just
the answer to their prayers!</p></li>
<li><p>Dig for Withdrawn Listings. When a homeowner isn’t sure whether or not they want to
sell or rent their home, they can be wishy-washy about posting it for sale. I have seen some
homes placed on the market only to be pulled off again a month later. If you check out the
history of the property (which anyone can do on Zillow or Trulia), you can see how many
times the owner has done this. Maybe nobody was offering the right price or they weren’t one
hundred percent sure they wanted to sell it. Ask your real estate broker to contact the owner
with expressed interest in their property to see if they will entertain the idea of selling.</p></li>

<li><p>Find Expired Listings. If a seller’s agent fails to sell a home, then the listing expires
after the duration of the contract, typically after six months or one year. Perhaps other buyers
thought the asking price was too high or unrealistic compared to others in the market, or maybe
the homeowner just had a lazy real estate agent. It happens!<br/>
A current client of mine who is selling her home said, “My previous agent did nothing. He
just stuck a sign on my lawn and that’s it. I had to market the house myself because he didn’t
bring any prospects over and never had one single open house. I think he only showed the
place twice in the entire time I hired him.”</p></li>

<li><p> Network. Talk to people about your desire to find a place in a certain neighborhood or
district.  Chances  are,  they know  somebody who  has  been on the  fence  about selling their
house, and maybe the two of you can sort it out! Don’t forget to bring your agent along to help
you with the negotiating.</p></li>

<li><p>Consider “For Sale by Owner” Homes (aka FSBO’s). Some rookie sellers choose to sell
their home without the help of a realtor, either due to having had a bad experience with a lazy
real estate agent or just being stubborn, or thinking they can do it better alone, or because they
don’t want to pay a commission. What they fail to realize is that by doing this, they do not have
the reach or the clout that hiring an agency can offer. Nevertheless, you may just find one of
these homes either by driving by and seeing a sign, or even through the previously mentioned
tip of networking.</p></li>

<div class="flex-rectangle"><h2>CHILL PILL #10</h2>
<p>Enduring inventory shortage does not mean that you will be unable to find the perfect house to
buy; it simply means you might have to wait longer to find it. As they say, sometimes you have
to kiss a lot of frogs before you find a prince, and this applies to house shopping, too!</p></div>

  <h2>WHAT IS THE MAGIC NUMBER?</h2>
 
 <p><strong>IN THE PROPERTY INDUSTRY, THE “MAGIC NUMBER”</strong> that lenders request you pay toward the purchase
of your house is 20 percent of the purchase price. Yes, you can get an FHA loan (Federal Housing
Administration) with 3.5 percent down or even find a program for 10 percent down. But 20 percent is
the down payment amount that lenders have determined minimizes risk level. Therefore, if you put
down 20 percent upfront, your lender sees you as someone who is less likely to default on the loan
than those who have no vested interest. In other words, you are a serious-minded buyer.</p>
<p>A sizable investment gives you an extra incentive to meet your mortgage repayments, because if
you default and lose your house, then you will have also lost a significant amount of money. Your
ability to save for a 20 percent down payment also demonstrates to the mortgage lender that you are
able to budget, save, and that you are fiscally responsible. These types of borrowers are more likely
to  carry  some  kind  of  investment  or  savings  account,  thereby  assuring  the  likeliness  of  having
sufficient funds available to make timely mortgage payments.</p>

<h3>ADVANTAGES OF A 20 PERCENT DOWN PAYMENT</h3>

<ul>
<li><p> Lenders perceive you as less of a risk, so they are more likely to offer you a better interest
rate than those who put less money up front. As a result, you will save thousands of dollars on
the reduced interest costs during the life of the loan.</p></li>

<li><p>The less you need to borrow, the smaller your monthly repayments, and the less interest you
will need to pay overall. Your payments will be lower, thereby making it more comfortable for
you and your family to enjoy life, rather than being “house poor.”</p></li>

<li><p>Additionally, with a 20 percent down payment, many lenders won’t require you to purchase
private mortgage insurance (PMI), which protects the lender against non-payment should you
default on your loan.</p></li>

<li><p>The 20 percent down payment represents the equity in your home. At a later stage, you can
borrow against this equity if you want to remodel or for other reasons.</p></li>
</ul>

<div class="flex-rectangle"><h2>CHILL PILL #11</h2>
<p>Do you want a lower interest rate? Lenders offer better interest rates to borrowers with lower
loan-to-value ratios. Increasing your down payment lowers the ratio and reduces the risk to the
lender. In the long run, lower interest rates can save you thousands of dollars over the life of
the mortgage.</p></div>

<h3>CAN YOU BUY WITH A 10 PERCENT DOWN PAYMENT?</h3>

<p>Depending on the cost of your home, a 20 percent down payment can represent a large amount of
money. Many homebuyers have difficulty saving up for a large down payment, understandably so. It
might take years, particularly given other financial pressures a buyer may have.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is your contingency plan. It’s not just the 20 percent down payment you
must plan for. Most industry experts recommend also keeping three to six months’ worth of mortgage
payments in a savings account, just in case something happens. You never know when a job loss,
family illness, or unexpected emergency might strap your financial means. Living without a savings
account is living on the edge, never knowing if something will happen that might cause you to be late
paying your mortgage, which can lead to a financial snowball effect!</p>
<p>Plus, there are closing costs, home insurance, moving costs, and agent fees to consider. Some
people don’t think of these things and anticipate putting their entire savings into the down payment.
Talk about starting off on the wrong foot right from the very beginning!</p>
<p>That said, there may be another disadvantage to waiting until you have saved up enough to make a
20 percent down payment. It might take years to save up that much money, and considering home
inflation, the waiting game might not be in your best interest. A smaller down payment could be as
little as 5–10 percent, depending on what the lender is prepared to accept based upon your credit
score and the type of risk you represent.</p>
<p>So if you are anxious to buy a house without having to wait until the entire 20 percent down
payment has been saved, you must weigh the disadvantages accordingly. You will have to pay for
private mortgage insurance; your interest rate may be higher; and therefore your monthly mortgage
payment will be higher as a result.</p>

  <h2>DON’T DIG TOO DEEP JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE A SHOVEL</h2>

<p>We’ve all heard the expression of someone whose “eyes are bigger than their stomach.” It refers to
someone who fills up a plate of food that is more than they can eat, just because it looks good.</p>
<p>This expression could also apply to the mortgage process. The bank may offer to loan you more
than what you are expecting, based upon your financial picture.</p><p>Just because the bank is willing to lend you a certain amount—which is disclosed to you during
the preapproval process—does not mean that you have to buy a home that costs that much. This is
definitely one of the biggest pitfalls to avoid, and I can’t stress it enough! If you have a yellow
highlighter, dig it out and remember this wisdom. It can be the key difference between enjoyable
homeownership versus financial struggles and regret. Happiness is the underlying reason why people
want  to  own their  own home,  so  let’s  make  sure  we  keep  it  that  way even when it  comes  to
manageability of your finances.</p>
<p>The bank or mortgage professionals are calculating your spending power based on what they see
on your credit profile. If you have additional expenditures that are not on your credit report, then
chances are the final preapproval amount they give you will be higher than what you can actually
afford to spend. For instance, childcare will not show up on your report. If you take care of an elderly
family member or if you are paying off a private loan, those things will not be a consideration in
reviewing your monthly financial threshold. So you may want to share that information with them up
front. Or at the very least, mentally modify the amount to reflect your true financial picture. Let’s say
you are preapproved for a mortgage that costs $2,800 per month, but you know you have an additional
$800 outgoing that has not been accounted for. In this case, you should scale back to a mortgage that
will only cost you $2,000 per month.</p>
<p>If a home price seems outside of your means, then go with your instinct. Instead of buying a
$300,000 house, for example, perhaps you could find something that still meets your needs in the
$200,000  range.  It  may  not  have  the  swimming  pool  in  the  backyard,  but  you  can  always  add
enhancements to your property later on when you are financially able. Trust me on this! You’ll thank
me later.</p>


<div class="flex-rectangle"><h2>CHILL PILL #12</h2>
<p>Just because the bank thinks you look great on paper does not mean you should borrow all of
the funds that they are willing to lend. Why? You’re going to have to pay it back with interest!
Over-extending yourself is a bad idea. Stick to your original budget.</p></div>

<p>Let’s  face  it:  Most homebuyers  finance  the  majority of their  home’s  purchase  price  within a
mortgage loan. So, consider that whatever amount you put down up front determines the total you must
borrow and the subsequent payments each month. Put it all down on paper first, looking at it from a
conservative perspective.</p>
<p>As I pointed out earlier in the app, there may be several benefits to purchasing when you have
saved enough for a down payment of 20 percent or more. This is just my way of giving you a nudge on
the right track to homeownership, but the choice is ultimately yours!</p>
<p>Understandably, the whole process of buying a home comes with many learning experiences. A
good real estate broker can walk you through all of the necessary steps, even if it means providing
you with a checklist or perhaps discussing these matters prior to searching for the right house. But you
may want to start wrapping your mind around some ways you can prepare now to be an attractive
homebuyer on paper for the banks. This next chapter should help.</p>

  <h2>HOW TO WIN THE BATTLE IN A BIDDING WAR: FIVE TIPS TO HELP YOU SUCCEED</h2>
  <p>Even if another buyer has made an offer on the house you want, keep calm. This does not mean that
you are out of the running. While a multiple-offer situation may put the seller in a more powerful
position than the potential buyers, it doesn’t mean you need to panic. What it does mean is that there’s
a possibility you may have to pay more for that particular home than you anticipated. You will also
have to be more flexible than some of the other buyers to put yourself in the most favorable position
with the seller.</p>
<p>If this is the house of your dreams, aren’t you willing to fight for it? Don’t dwell on the fact that
you could have made an offer sooner. Let the bidding war begin, my friends! Your sword is your
trusty pen!</p>
<p>While offering the most money might seem like the best way to win a bidding war, sellers don’t
always choose the highest offer. Instead, sellers often prefer offers that are most likely to go through
and that meet their conditions. For instance, if your lease is expiring in the next sixty days and you’re
in a rush to get to the closing table, but the seller wants ninety days to move because they haven’t yet
found the new home they plan to purchase and move into, the seller may be inclined to take a slightly
lower offer from a more flexible buyer rather than the higher bid you put in.</p>
<p>Keep your eyes on the prize. Stay focused, and don’t give up the fight. To help arm you with the
leverage you need to be victorious in this battle, I’m going to give you five ways to succeed at a
bidding war to buy the house you truly want.</p>
<div data-role="collapsible-set">
  <div data-role="collapsible">
    <h3>Have all your paperwork in order</h3>
    <p> Sellers want to know where your money is coming
from. When submitting your offer, be prepared to show your preapproval mortgage eligibility
letter showing the amount you are approved for. It must be at least as much as you are offering
to pay for the house. If you intend to pay cash for the house, you will need a POF (proof of
funds) certified letter or bank statement verifying that you have enough liquid funds available
to purchase the home. This shows the seller that you’re serious and have all your ducks in a
row.</p>
  </div>
  <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
    <h3>Forget lowball offers–make  your best offer now! </h3>
    <p>In today’s climate where housing
inventory shortages seem prevalent all across the country, by the time you get in to view a
home, there may often be one or more offers on the table. You may only have one shot to get
this right, so don’t be coy. Make your best offer now! Have your buyer’s agent do the research
on recent sale prices of comparable properties in the neighborhood, and go for it!</p>
  </div>
  <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
    <h3>The personal touch goes a long way</h3>
    <p>Try to separate yourself from all the other paper
offers by personalizing it. Write a letter to the homeowner telling them why you love the house
so much. Give them some background information about yourself. Even adding a family photo
to the top of the offer  has worked for  a few  of my buyers over  the years. It’s often more
difficult to say no to someone you feel you know versus a complete stranger.</p>
  </div>
  <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
    <h3>Eliminate or reduce contingencies</h3>
    <p> One of the best ways to make your offer stronger is
to eliminate contingencies. If you’re a first-time homebuyer, you may not be in a position to
waive a mortgage contingency like a more seasoned buyer. However, if you are a veteran
buyer who is re-entering the marketplace for a second, third, or maybe even a fourth time, you
may have  large  cash reserves  on hand  that show  that you could  in fact purchase  a  house
outright in lieu of getting a mortgage. This could make you more attractive to a seller tasked
with making the tough decision of which offer to take.<br/>
Now  of course, I am not encouraging you to run out and put up your  savings  or  401K
retirement accounts as collateral to purchase a home you really should be getting a mortgage
on. What I am saying is this: If you know beyond a shadow of a doubt that your credit profile is
up to par, your bank statements are in order, your income-to-debt ratio is not out of whack, and
you can show proof of sufficient employment (all of which would make you mortage-worthy),
you could consider leveraging your cash status to your benefit to come out on top in a bidding
war.</p>
  </div>
  <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
    <h3>Be very flexible!</h3>
    <p> Being flexible on the terms of the agreement can give you a leg up.
Something as simple as allowing the seller to determine the closing date is a small courtesy
that could make a big difference when trying win over an uncertain seller.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>By the way, bidding wars can get emotional quickly, especially if you’ve fallen in love with a
home. It’s important to remain mindful of your financial limitations. Devise a “walkaway number”
upfront. That dollar amount represents the highest price you’d be willing to pay for that home. Alwayshave the number in the back of your mind so that you know when it’s time to move on.</p>

  <h2>ADD THIS MEMBER TO YOUR REAL ESTATE DREAM TEAM:LAWYER UP!</h2>
  
  <p>I get the question in almost every real estate transaction I am involved in: “Egypt, do I really need to
hire an attorney?” The answer is both simple and complex. Every state has different requirements.
Some states leave it as an option to the buyer and seller, while others mandate it as a necessity.</p>
<p>Your local real estate agent should be able to advise you on the protocol in the area in which you
are buying. That’s the simple answer. The complex answer has to do with your particular situation.
For  most  people,  their  home  is  the  biggest  purchase  they’ll  ever  make.  They sign mountains  of
paperwork for both the loan and the property itself. In a good number of cases, they don’t have their
own attorney and everything goes smoothly. Other times, an attorney’s fee more than pays for itself.</p>
<p>If legal  issues  arise  that your  real  estate  agent can’t answer,  you’ll  need  an attorney’s  help.
Although good agents know a lot about the negotiating and contracting part of the process, they can’t
make judgments on legal questions.</p>
<p>For example, what if your prospective new home has an in-law unit with an existing tenant whom
you want to evict in order to rent the place to a friend? Only a lawyer can tell you with any certainty
whether your plans are feasible. Or, if you’re drafting any unusual language for the purchase contract,
or are concerned about some language in your mortgage, you may want to have an attorney look the
documents over.</p>
<p>A good  real  estate  attorney can also  relieve  you from some  of the  frustrations  of the  buying
process. You can dish some of the duties off to your attorney. “Call my lawyer,” you can tell the bank
representative if there’s a question you don’t have the answer to. Isn’t it nice to have someone on your
professional team who is looking out for you?</p>
<p>Your  real  estate  agent  has  your  back,  but  when  they  don’t  have  the  answers  to  your  legal
questions, you can call your real estate attorney to get the answers you need.</p>

<h3>HERE ARE SOME OTHER CONSIDERATIONS FOR HIRING A REAL ESTATE ATTORNEY:</h3>
<br/>
<strong>Buyers</strong>
<ul>
<li><p>Are you an out-of-town buyer?</p></li>
<li><p>Are you buying a property that is a short sale or bank-owned?</p></li>
<li><p>Are you buying a property that is part of an estate sale?</p></li>
<li><p>Are you buying a commercial property?</p></li>
<li><p>Are you buying a property that could potentially have structural issues?</p></li>
<li><p>Are you buying a property in a problematic area such as a flood zone or areas with adverse
conditions (tornado prone, or with high radon or toxicity levels)?</p></li>
</ul>
<strong>Sellers</strong>
<ul>
<li><p>Are you selling a property that is in some state of distress?</p></li>
<li><p>Are you the heir or executor of a property whose owner is now deceased?</p></li>

<li><p>Are you selling a house with a non-cooperative partner?</p></li>

<li><p>Do you have that gut feeling that something could possibly go wrong based on your
knowledge of the property?</p></li>

<li><p>Do you have judgments or liens in your background?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you answered yes to any of the above questions, then hiring an attorney to guide you through the
process would definitely be beneficial. If none of those apply to you and you have discussed your
situation with your realtor, then it’s probably fine to use your realtor’s knowledge and expertise to
take you through to closing. Rest assured, as part of a realtor’s licensing education, we are taught
about and tested on the real estate contracts used within the state that holds our license.</p>
<p>Another question I am often asked is, “My best friend’s cousin is an attorney and would do it for
me either free or at low cost. Can I use him? He’s not a real estate attorney, but an attorney is an
attorney, right?” <em>wrong!</em></p>
<p>You wouldn’t go to a gynecologist for a heart valve replacement, would you? Of course not! Nor
would you go to a neurosurgeon to have a root canal. Even though they are all doctors who have taken
the Hippocratic Oath, they don’t specialize in the same type of medical care. Selecting a real estate
attorney is no different.</p>
<p>The agreement of sale in a real estate transaction is possibly the single most important piece of
the entire deal. It is the legally binding document that pulls together all components, obligations, and
covenants associated with a real estate deal. Do not hire any old attorney who has a general title.</p>
<p>Find a legitimate and experienced real estate attorney who specializes in real estate law, and who
performs real estate transactions day in and day out. Even if you have a family lawyer who handles
most of your personal and individual matters, this person or firm may not be the best person to hire
for your real estate transaction unless, of course, they handle real estate law.</p>
<div class="flex-rectangle"><h2>CHILL PILL #17</h2>
<p>When buying a property, choose an attorney who specializes in real estate. You are entitled to
receive a copy of your closing statement from the attorney no less than 24 hours before
settlement. Be sure to review it so you won’t have any shocking surprises.</p></div>

<p>I have seen scenarios where “Uncle Gus,” a general attorney, makes changes to the contract in aneffort to protect the buyer that are not reasonable. This inflames the seller and the whole transaction
blows up. By using a non-real  estate specific attorney, you put yourself at great risk of potential
financial loss and even possible litigation.</p>
<p>From the latter part of 2010 until the present day, many regulations have been put in place to
protect homeowners and banks alike. When contracts come into play, it’s important to go with a pro
and more importantly, a specialist. Purchasing a home is the type of business transaction that requires
an advanced understanding of the real estate laws, rules, and procedures by someone who stays up-
to-date on the many changes within the industry.</p>
<p>In some  states,  a  real  estate  attorney takes  over  after  the  selling price  and  terms  have  been
established by the realtors in the contract and all parties have signed. He will review the contract
itself, negotiate repairs based on the home inspection report, and collaborate with the title company.</p>
<p>He will also be with you at settlement along with your realtor and possibly your lending agent. All of
these people are working for you to make sure you are protected.</p>

<h3>HOW MUCH DOES A REAL ESTATE ATTORNEY COST?</h3>

<p>Depending on where  you live, hiring a  real  estate  attorney typically costs  from $800 to $1,500.
Compare  the  costs  in  your  specific  area  by  calling  around  for  estimates.  For  die-hard  bargain
shoppers who are always trying to disprove the adage <em>“you get what you pay for,”</em> I wish you good
luck with Uncle Gus. If it were me, this is one area I wouldn’t want to take my chances.</p>

<h3>HOW DO I HIRE A GOOD ATTORNEY?</h3>
<p>Hiring a real estate lawyer might sound like an easy thing to do. It’s as simple as going on your
computer and typing “real estate attorney” in your web browser, along with your zip code, right?
  <em>Wrong!</em></p>
<p>Hiring a solid real estate lawyer is not the same as buying a new bedroom set on Overstock.com.
The  seemingly  endless  choices  might  appear  similar  in  comparison,  but  making  a  good  choice
requires  more  thought  than whether  or  not  to  go  with a  king or  queen,  or  pink versus  tan and
periwinkle blue. Instead of searching for a deal on a prospective lawyer, you should hire the best real
estate attorney for the job, making sure they are one that you can afford.</p>
<p>Referrals and recommendations may be your best source for finding a person in your local area.</p>
<p>Your real estate agent is probably knowledgeable and has worked with many different lawyers over
the years. They often know who is best and whose face they see most often at the closing table. If your
agent doesn’t have anyone in mind, then consider recommendations from colleagues at work, family
members, friends, or neighbors who have recently purchased or sold homes. Ask if they were happy
with the  way the  real  estate  attorney handled  their  transaction,  and  inquire  whether  they would
recommend this person without reservation.</p>

  <h2>YOUR SECRET NEGOTIATING WEAPON</h2>
  <p>Many buyers  get caught up  in the  emotional  aspects  of a  home  and  overlook common flaws  or
imperfections as they see only the best features. This makes it nearly impossible for them to anticipate
any problems with the house prior to making an offer, and sometimes the buyers waive the right to an
inspection altogether. While a home inspection is not a foolproof method of avoiding problems, it
does become a great tool for negotiation.</p>
<p>Just for that fact alone, hiring a home inspector is worth it. A licensed professional inspector can
pinpoint things  that need  replacing,  servicing,  repairing,  or  redoing altogether.  The  few  hundred
dollars it will cost for the services will arm you with a powerful tool to bring to the closing table.</p>
<p>A home  inspection is  an evaluation that occurs  when the  prospective  buyer  hires  a  licensed
individual to go to the property for a thorough walk-through to determine the physical, mechanical,
structural, and cosmetic condition of the house. The inspector’s role is to be unbiased and offer an
impartial perspective, often pointing out things that you should be aware of in advance so that you’re
not caught off guard down the road. Such items might set you back financially or even pose potential
hazards. Getting them taken care of before closing is in your best interest. After the deed is in your
name, it’s too late!</p>
<p>I should make it clear that your inspector should not be anyone close to you, such as a friend,
relative, or family acquaintance, unless they are certified and bonafide. Even if your friend happens to
be  a  builder  or  a  contractor  by  trade,  this  doesn’t  save  you  money  in  the  long  run.  Building
contractors are different than licensed home inspectors. So although they may be qualified to notice a
few  things,  there  are  many unique  points  that a  professional  licensed  inspector  will  cover  with
meticulous observation.</p>
<p>The home inspector’s purpose is to explain to their client what the condition of the house is in its
current state—both interior and exterior qualities—as well as the good and bad that he finds. By
knowing about these qualities ahead of time, you can request that some of the repairs be done prior to
purchasing the house. I should also make it clear that the inspector’s job is not to give you advice as
to whether or not you should buy the property; he or she merely remarks on the condition, value,
foreseeable problems, and necessary repairs that should be addressed.</p>
<p>After the inspection is complete, the home inspector will then present the buyer or client with asummary of these assessments, which is signed and can be notarized.</p>
<p>Before you choose an inspector, make sure you check their history, knowledge, reputation, and
certifications.  There  are  some  professions  in  which  you  must  be  wary  of  scammers,  and  this
unfortunately happens to be one of them. Most any person can say they are a home inspector, but do
they have the experience to back the results? It pays to inquire.</p>
<p>Any “pro” home inspector will carry a state-sanctioned inspector’s certification, which means he
has  been trained  and  licensed.  He  will  also  carry insurance  and  be  a  member  of  the  National
Association of Home  Inspectors,  which is  a  highly respected  trade  organization that  ensures  its
members operate under a code of ethics. Currently, thirty-nine states require that home inspectors
carry this  certification.  If  they do  not  have  it,  then move  on to  another  inspector  who  is  more
qualified. Believe me: Spending the money on a legitimate professional who carries a license can pay
off greatly over time.</p>
<p>It’s better to find out if your home of interest needs anything repaired prior to purchase rather than
finding out a few months down the road that the whole roof needs to be replaced or that the home is
filled with dangerous asbestos that could harm your family and pets!</p>

  <h2>REFERRALS MATTER! HOW TO FIND THE RIGHT HOME INSPECTOR</h2>
  <p>Ask your real estate agent for referrals, or family and friends who have recently purchased houses in
the area. Here are some tips:</p>

<ul>
<li><p> If you are looking online, make sure the inspector has a legitimate website and professional
presentation.</p></li>

<li><p>Call and speak with at least two or three inspectors to compare notes about their rates,
experience, and what they will deliver and how fast.</p></li>

<li><p>Find out if the inspector is an accredited member of any professional organizations that
serve the home inspection industry.</p></li>

<li><p>Do they guarantee accuracy of the inspection and on the inspection report? What are the
final document(s) they will prepare for you?</p></li>

<li><p>Although fewer people check with the BBB (Better Business Bureau) these days, you can
do this if you wish. It may behoove you to do a search online to find out if any complaints have
ever been filed. Sometimes people also leave reviews.</p></li>

<li><p>Ask questions! How many years have they been in business? Does the inspector have any
formal training to do home inspections? A qualified inspector has at least seven to ten years
under their belt, and no, internet classes do not count as “formal training”!</p></li>

<li><p>Don’t forget to ask if your home inspector has errors and omissions insurance. This is a
necessity in today’s real estate industry, especially after the housing crisis. If something turns up
that your inspector did not catch, they will be held legally liable.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, consider where the referral for the home inspector came from. If it came from your Uncle
Mike, who “knows a guy who has a next-door neighbor who does inspections,” this may not be as
good a referral as one given by your real estate agent, who deals with home inspections all the time.</p>

<h3>EXACTLY WHAT DOES A HOME INSPECTION COVER?</h3>  
<p>Here are most of the things a home inspector will look at to determine if they are in good, working
condition or in need of repairs:</p>

<ul>
<li>Kitchen and laundry appliances</li>
<li>Bathrooms, vents, bath and shower</li>
<li> Foundation or basement</li>
<li> The building’s framing, walls, and structure</li>
<li> AC unit/heating system (hot and cool air units) furnace and vents</li>
<li> Electrical wiring, fuse boxes, age of electrical system</li>
<li> Non-cosmetic interior elements, like outlet covers and light fixtures</li>
<li> Plumbing system</li>
<li> Insulation</li>
<li> Windows and doors</li>
<li> Attic and chimney</li>
<li> Roof</li>
</ul>

<p>The inspector will  be keeping an eye out for signs of dampness and mold as well  as wood-
destroying insects during the inspection. Some inspection companies also go the extra mile by testing
for lead, radon, asbestos, carbon monoxide, and other hazardous toxins within the home.</p>
<p>In rural towns and municipalities where well water and septic systems are the norm, it is often
required that buyers and/or sellers have special system flushings and inspections performed. Licensed
pest-control inspectors are recommended to avoid the presence of commonly found carpenter ants and
termites. A state-certified mold remediation company should be called should any dampness reveal
evidence of mold. While your home inspector is not the one to perform these type of inspections, they
may be a valuable resource in referring you to reputable companies who offer those sorts of services.</p>

  <h2>FAQS ABOUT INSPECTIONS</h2>
  <p>Here are eight of the most commonly asked questions about inspections:</p>
  <div data-role="collapsible-set">
    <div data-role="collapsible">
      <h3>1. WHEN EXACTLY DOES A HOME INSPECTION TAKE PLACE?</h3>
      <p>The  home  inspection  phase  occurs  during  the  “due  diligence”  period,  after  an  offer  has  been
accepted. After signing an accepted offer for a home, the clock starts ticking. Buyers standardly have
anywhere  from seven to  fourteen days  to  get any inspections  done  and  to  negotiate  repairs  or  a
financial credit with the seller.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
      <h3>2. HOW MUCH DOES AN INSPECTION COST?</h3>
      <p>In a real estate transaction, inspectors are hired by the homebuyer and can range from $300 to $600,
depending on what services you request. In addition to a standard inspection, you can request testing
for  radon,  carbon  monoxide,  and  wood-eating  insects.  The  more  you  request,  the  higher  your
inspection bill will be.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
      <h3>3. HOW LONG DOES AN INSPECTION TAKE?</h3>
      <p>The inspection itself will take anywhere between two and five hours, depending on the size of the
property, the length of time it takes to measure and take account of each room, and other factors. Youshould find out whether the home inspector charges a flat rate or an hourly fee, because if the person
is a conversationalist and likes to stay and talk a lot while on the job, an hourly arrangement could be
more costly than a fixed price.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
      <h3>4. DO I NEED TO ATTEND THE INSPECTION?</h3>
      <p>The answer is a resounding yes! You should absolutely be there for the inspection. This is to ensure
the inspection is  done up to your  expectations, as well  as  to make yourself available in case of
questions.</p>
<p>Within a few days, the inspection report will be available. Some inspectors can send the report to
you on the same day. You may receive the report as a PDF that can be emailed to you, or you may
choose to have it mailed or dropped off to you in person.</p>
<p>The benefit of having a report in hand is twofold. It offers you peace of mind that the residence of
your  choice  is  worth buying,  and  it’s  also  a  powerful  negotiation tool.  The  inspection company
provides the report on professional business stationery to make a good impression on the seller and
their real estate firm.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
      <h3>5. IF THE HOME FAILS INSPECTION?</h3>
      <p>Believe it or not, this happens a lot, and does not have to be the end of the world or the end of a deal.
It is standard practice to request that the seller address anything that did not pass the inspection.
Leaky roof, water penetration, mold in the basement, and rodent infestation are examples of a few
negative marks that can show up on the report. It is within your right to ask that the seller fix them
prior  to purchase or  to request a financial  credit from the seller  in order  to have them repaired
yourself after closing.<br/>
In your purchase agreement, you will likely find a section pertaining to your right to have a home
inspection and also a right to waive this opportunity. This is a common clause on any real estate
purchase and sales agreement. The agreement states that you will get a refund of your earnest money
deposit if the home does not meet your approval upon inspection, should you decide to terminate the
deal altogether.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
      <h3>6. Want SKIP A HOME INSPECTION?</h3>
      <p>The reasons buyers forgo the home inspection vary, from the over-zealous new buyer who adamantly
gives the property a “once-over” with the naked eye, to the investor who feels using one of their own
contractors is sufficient, to families who are already on a tight budget and want to save a little money
on the closing costs. Too many people have learned the hard way that skipping a home inspection by a
licensed inspector is always a bad idea! Don’t forget about Mr. Know-It All.<br/>
That, my friends, is why I have devoted an entire chapter on this very topic! It is that important.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
      <h3>7. WHAT IF OTHER BUYERS ARE MAKING AN OFFER ON THE
PROPERTY AND THEY WAIVE THE INSPECTION CONTINGENCY?</h3>
      <p>WHAT IF OTHER BUYERS ARE MAKING AN OFFER ON THE
PROPERTY AND THEY WAIVE THE INSPECTION CONTINGENCY?</p>
<p>If you feel that putting your foot down and asking for repairs will weaken your position with a seller
who has multiple offers on the table, then bring a licensed contractor or handyman with you on a
follow-up visit to check the home out prior to writing an offer. This way you can determine if the
home  is  in good  condition up  front,  then draft  up  an offer  that  is  not  contingent  on inspection.
Something like this should only be done for special circumstances when there is stiff competition.</p>
    </div>
       
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
      <h3>8. IS AN INSPECTION THE ONLY WAY I CAN GET HISTORY ABOUT
A HOUSE?</h3>
      <p>IS AN INSPECTION THE ONLY WAY I CAN GET HISTORY ABOUT
A HOUSE?</p>
<p>Request that your real estate agent provide you with a full list of disclosures available on the home.
Read them thoroughly. If there are multiple offers, you may need to consider whether an inspection
contingency will hurt your chances (see FAQ #7). But if yours is the only offer on the table, you’ll
definitely want to go the full nine yards with inspection.<br/>
Find out up front the turnaround time for your inspection report. Make sure your inspector knows
that time is critical, since you may not have a full day or even two to three days to put your offer in
before someone else does. Some home inspectors can turn a report around within twenty-four hours,
while others require at least three days. Usually, an inspector can tell you the condition of the home
right then and there. If you must, you can base your decision to move forward from their verbal
conclusions. <br/>
Again, don’t let somebody sway you into thinking that a home inspection is not necessary. A
friend, co-worker, or relative may say something like, “Oh, just go with your instincts.” Or, “I didn’t
get an inspection when I bought my house and everything was fine. That’s just extra money you’ll have
to spend, it’s not worth it.” <br/>
Tell them, “Thanks, but no thanks!” for their advice. Tell them about a story you read in my book
about a guy who “knew it all” but ended up being stuck with a $20,000 repair bill for basement
flooding and kitchen damage caused by faulty electrical issues . . . all of which could have been
avoided if he would have just listened to his real estate agent.</p>

  <h2>APPRAISAL METHODS</h2>
  
  <p>When you apply for a mortgage, your lender typically requires the property be appraised by one of
their approved licensed appraisers. This practice helps create more consistent appraisals and gives
you assurance that the appraiser is properly credentialed and that their findings are held in the highest
regard by your mortgage lender. Even though the home appraisal is the lender’s requirement, it is the
borrower’s responsibility. You usually pay for it as part of the financing costs at the time of closing.</p>
<p>The cost is typically around $300 (give or take a few dollars) depending on the size of the property.</p>
<p>There  are  two  primary  appraisal  methods  for  residential  property.  In  the  sales-comparison
approach, the appraiser compares the property with four or five similar homes that have sold in the
area, often called comparables, or “comps.” This method is very similar to what your real estate
agent  does  during  comparative  market  analysis,  the  difference  being  that  a  comparative  market
analysis  is  more  informal.  An appraisal  considers  specific  components,  such as  lot size,  square
footage of finished and unfinished space, style and age of house, as well as other features, such as
garages and fireplaces.</p>
<p>The cost approach to appraisal is used more often for new property and is based on reproduction
costs.  The  appraiser  estimates  the  cost  to  replace  the  structure  if  it  were  to  be  destroyed.  The
appraiser then looks at land value and depreciation to determine the property’s total worth.</p>
<p>The  appraiser  gathers  information for  the  appraisal  report from a  number  of sources, but the
process often begins with a physical inspection of the property inside and out. This is a less in-depth
assessment than the home inspector’s, but it is no less important. Additionally, the appraiser may look
at county courthouse records and recent reports from the local real estate multiple listing services.</p>
<p>The  difference  between a  real  estate  agent doing a  CMA and  a  licensed  appraiser  doing a  full
appraisal is the level of science, analysis, and detail that go into the appraiser’s methodology.</p>

<div class="flex-rectangle"><h2>CHILL PILL #20</h2>
<p>A common myth about home appraisal is that curb appeal and general cleanliness of the home
will help bring a higher appraisal amount. While overall maintenance of the home and
surrounding property are indeed factors, details such as dirty dishes in the sink or a lawn that
needs to be mowed do not affect the appraisal.</p></div>

  <h2>WHAT DOES THE APPRAISAL REPORT INCLUDE?</h2>
  The appraisal report generally includes:
  <ul>
  <li><p>A comparative market analysis that supports the appraisal</p></li>
  
  <li><p>The size and condition of the house and other permanent fixtures, along with a description
of any improvements that have been made and the materials used</p></li>

<li><p>An explanation of how the appraiser determined the value of the property</p></li>

<li><p>Statements regarding serious structural problems, such as a damp basement or cracked
foundation</p></li>

<li><p>Notes about the surrounding area or community</p></li>

<li><p>An evaluation of recent market trends in the area that may affect the value</p></li>

<li><p>Maps and photographs</p></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Keep in mind that the appraisal amount is not only for the house itself. In fact, the figure considers
the total value of the home, any other structural upgrades and permanent fixtures, along with the land
that the house is built on.</p>

  <h2>THREE THINGS TO KNOW IF THE APPRAISAL COMES IN TOO LOW</h2>
  
  <p>Imagine that you learn that your dream home is only valued at $249,000—a full $26,000 lower than
the asking price! If you are the buyer, this figure means that the amount you can finance the property
for is much lower than you expected, because the lender will only loan up to the appraised amount.</p>
<p>And you already have an accepted offer! An appraised value that is considerably lower than what you
have offered should be a red light—a warning that you may be paying too much. So is the deal over?
Is it time to panic and throw in the towel?</p>
<p>First, I’d recommend taking a look at what may have caused the low appraisal. It might be due to
factors  that the  homeowner  could  correct,  such as  repairs  or  maintenance.  If that’s  the  case,  the
appraiser may be willing to take a second look and adjust the appraisal accordingly.</p>
<p>Second, you always have the option to order a second appraisal. This may be a good idea if the
first  appraiser  is  inexperienced  or  unfamiliar  with  the  area  where  the  property  is  located.  It’s
possible that a second appraisal will uncover mistakes the first appraiser made. If you believe that an
appraisal is simply not an accurate representation of the property’s value, and the appraiser is not
willing to listen to your concerns, you can go to your state licensing agency for appraisers and file acomplaint.</p>
<p>So, what happens when you’ve exhausted both of those options? Your lender won’t loan more
than the appraisal. So what do you do? Here are three options:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Have your attorney or agent go back to the sellers with the new appraisal. Perhaps the
seller will lower the asking price or carry a second mortgage to make up the difference. After
all, if the house won’t appraise well for you, nine times out of ten it won’t appraise well for
anyone.</p></li>

<li><p>Pay the difference between the selling price and appraisal price out of pocket. Although
it’s not my favorite option, if the buyers love the house and they know they’ll be in it long
enough to see the value rise, then this becomes a viable option. To determine if this option
makes sense, consider what the difference in price is.</p></li>

<li><p>Lastly, if negotiations fall through and the appraisal is still too far below what the bank is
willing to finance, then there is no other choice than to cancel the transaction. Walk away and
don’t look back! You’ve  done  all  you can do.  You probably signed  a  purchasing contract
stating  your  offer  for  the  property,  but  if  your  agent  has  advised  you  well,  it  will  have
contained an appraisal contingency and a loan contingency, each of which may give you an
“out” should certain conditions not be met. This is a statement that allows you to cancel the
contract and receive any deposit you paid the seller if you don’t qualify to buy the property at
the agreed terms.</p></li>
</ol>
  
  <p>With those  things  in mind,  let the  appraiser  do  his  job.  Questions  and  banter  may make  the
inspection go slowly or make the appraiser miss something. It is wise to take your own set of notes
while the appraiser assessing. Then, when he is done, feel free to ask any questions you may have.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve gotten a thorough understanding of “Appraisals 101,” let’s move onto the traps
and catch-22s I want to save every homebuyer the headache of ever having to experience! Are you
still with me? Good! Strap on your seatbelt, and let’s go!</p>

  <h2>NINE WAYS TO RUIN THE JOY OF BUYING A HOUSE</h2>
  
  <p>Have you ever seen the movie, <em>How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days?</em> It features the lovely Kate Hudson
doing everything in her power to “mess up” her relationship with a guy (Matthew McConaughey), all
for the sake of an article she is writing for a magazine.</p>
<p>Just like relationships, you can unknowingly ruin the joy of buying property. It can be quite a rush
to buy your own house, especially if this is the first time for you. You may be so overjoyed that you
can mess up the negotiating side, or forgo the inspection, or forget something really, really important
on your contract that, down the road, you will wish had been there. These are all good reasons to
solidify my advice of choosing professionals to work with you. If you have a team in place, the
process should be rather pleasant. If not, it can be downright nightmarish.</p>

<h3>AVOID THESE NINE HOMEBUYING NO-NO’S:</h3>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Being Overly Enthusiastic</strong>: You must be able to manage your emotions. You have to
show your “poker face” sometimes, at least in the presence of the seller. When you speak with
your real estate broker, though, you should be honest about your feelings. As an agent myself, I
much prefer clients who tell me openly about any concerns they might have, rather than waiting
until the last minute. It is our job to find you the right home that fits your needs and that you
will love to live in. Most realtors will bend over backward to do that for you, but if you have
any excitement or glee that you want to express in front of the seller, I would encourage you to
curb your enthusiasm.<br/>
It is great to be genuinely interested, but if they know you really want the place, it could
make them hold on the price instead of being flexible—just like in Tweet’s situation. Trust me;
it is difficult to deal with rigid sellers!</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Failing to Consider the Resale Value</strong>: People who buy a home for the first-time often
think they will live in it forever, but the reality is that on average, people only live in their first
two homes  for  seven to ten years. Circumstances  change and life happens, so it’s  vital  to
consider the resale value in any decision you make on a home. Perhaps you don’t mind living
three houses down from a liquor store. But chances are another buyer will when it’s time to
sell. Perhaps painting the house lime green seems like a joyous idea. But how many people do
you suppose will want to live in a house the color of a Popsicle? Not many. By all means,
enjoy the quality of your home to the utmost while you’re living there. However, when it comes
time to put that same house back on the market, be prepared to give it an overhaul. This is of
course if you’d like to get top market dollar when it sells.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Living Outside  of Your Financial Comfort Zone</strong>: Another error homebuyers tend to
make is getting caught up in living outside of their financial means. This can be one of your
biggest heartaches and regrets. The joys of homeownership can become your worst nightmare
if you make mistakes with the budget. Some buyers get dazzled by a particular home and so
they start thinking, “Well, it’s a little more than I planned on spending, but I’ll work extra hours
to make up the difference.” Or, “I should be getting a raise soon, so I will be able to afford it.”<br/>
This kind of thinking can get you in a lot of hot water! It happens all too often: unforeseen
circumstances arise that instantly change a family’s income level. No one can predict job loss,
death in the family, lawsuits, or IRS debts. And then there are the planned challenges such as
adding another child to the family or paying for college tuition. All of these can drastically
change your monthly bottom line.<br/>
You want to enjoy life, and not be stuck in survival mode. I’ve seen many families who end
up cutting themselves short, especially if unexpected expenses arise and leave them in a pinch.
If your car breaks down, for example, and the repairman tells you that it’s a $600 job, will that
hinder your ability to pay your mortgage for the month? It is better to make a purchase that is
completely manageable from the beginning. Then, when financial tornadoes come your way,
they won’t wipe you out.<br/>
I prefer to tell people that their mortgage payment should be equivalent to about one week’s
salary, or a quarter of your take-home pay (post-taxes) to be on the safe side. By choosing a
house that is affordable, you can enjoy being there more! People who are “house poor” often
have to work long, long hours to make up the difference of having a more expensive house,
thereby spending less time at home living in it and instead “working to live and living to
work.” I don’t know about you, but I’d rather be home digging in my flower garden or playing
with my daughter in the backyard on the weekends instead of working two or three jobs just to
cover my mortgage. Wouldn’t you agree?</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Not Having An Emergency Fund</strong>: Keep in mind that with homeownership also comes
unexpected expenses. If something breaks, you will shell out the money to fix it, unlike having
a landlord. It’s best to have a contingency account for those “just in case” scenarios that can
happen to anyone.<br/>
One idea I came up with to help people save for for these occasions is to use a Holiday
Club savings program. What’s a Holiday Club? Banks often have savings programs to help
customers save up for presents, and this is a similar idea. But there are other neat things about
it. For one, it is barely noticeable when you save $10 or $20 per week out of your paycheck;
whereas, if you were to add that up and try to come up with that much out of the blue, it could
set you back. CDs, mutual funds, and money market accounts are another good option, but only
if you are willing to put in a substantial lump sum to open the account. In contrast, the Holiday
Club is the same amount each week (usually $5, $10, $20, etc.). These smaller amounts can be
easier to manage and will pay off if you get in a jam with a surprise house repair.</p></li>

<li>
  <p><strong>Shopping for a Home  Before  Speaking with the  Bank</strong>:  This falls in line with my
prequalification and preapproval advice. Some misguided people start looking at homes with
their  real  estate  agent  before  speaking  to  the  bank.  This  can  present  a  real  snag  in  thehomebuying process  and  can drag it out for  weeks! There’s  nothing like  spending months
searching for the right house in your perceived $350,000 range. Then you finally find and make
an offer, only to get turned down by the bank when they say you should have been looking for a
$250,000 house instead of a $350,000 house. <em>Ouch!</em></p></li>

<li>
  <p><strong>Forgetting to Save for Furnishings and Other Necessities</strong>: After draining your bank
account to put money down on the house, it can be rather annoying to move in and have nothing
to sit or sleep on. Rather than racking up the credit cards at a furniture store, plan to save
enough in addition to your down payment to buy the essentials. Don’t forget about things you
will need to maintain your home, like a lawn mower or ladder, if you don’t already own these
things. Stash some money on the side to purchase what you need. This should be separate from
your “rainy day” account, which should have six months of living expenses in it.</p></li>

<li>
  <p><strong>Buying a Big Item Prior to Closing</strong>: I’ve seen it happen. A couple does all of the right
things, including getting preapproved, shopping for a house with an agent, and making sure the
home passes inspection. Then, while waiting to close on their home, they run out and purchase
three rooms of furniture on credit. This is a no-no! Banks approve you for your mortgage based
upon your credit score and savings at the time of approval. Your approval is contingent upon
those items remaining the same through closing. If you run up a $5,000 line of credit at a
furniture store, your credit score immediately changes. Banks check borrowers’ credit several
times  before  the  closing  contracts  are  signed.  If  your  mortgage  company  sees  any  major
changes in your credit, they may decline the loan or change the terms of the loan. It’s best not to
take any chances and just be patient on any big purchases.</p></li>

<li>
  <p> <strong>Buying Too Young:</strong> Young people  often have  more  chances  of moving,  for  a  career
change, for love, and many other reasons. When you’re in your early twenties, you may feel
like this is a place you’ll want to live forever, but by the next year some major life event could
change your plans. Please wait until you are stable before making such a huge commitment. I
don’t mean to dissuade any youngsters from buying. Afterall, I purchased my first property in
my early twenties. But it’s important to be mindful of this.</p></li>

<li>
  <p><strong>Buying a house with a boyfriend or girlfriend:</strong> Before I tell you a story, let me just say
that your love may not last as long as your relationship with the mortgage company, especially
if you are still getting to know someone. I have even seen couples who have been together a
long time—from seven to ten years—commit to buying a house jointly, but then things went
awry. It can be complicated to get someone else’s name off the mortgage and deed of the
property. If you want to live together, then I would recommend whomever in the relationship
has the best credit should make the purchase of the home solely in his or her name, to avoid the
hassle of a potentially sticky situation.</p></li>

</ol>

<p>I’ve had at least nine clients that I can think of off the top of my head experience the ugly truth of
these  common  mistakes.  The  one  who  best  illustrates  my  point  was  a  twenty-eight-year-old  ITmanager.</p> <p>When Geoff was referred to me, the poor guy was balding from stress. He’d been with his
girlfriend, Laura, since college, and they both assumed they’d get married one day, so they decided to
purchase a house first. After only a year of living in the home together, he fell in love with a coworker
and decided to break it off with his college sweetheart. Little did he know she wasn’t going to be
swept aside easily.</p>
<p>Although Geoff was paying the bulk of the bills, the home was in both of their names and Laura
refused to move out. In her eyes, he should be the one to move since he broke it off. Problem was, his
down payment was tied up in the house. And he knew she couldn’t afford to pay the mortgage on the
house herself if he left. He broke her heart, and it was clear she was planning to break his pockets.
Geoff decided to put the house on the market and try to sell and get out clean. Whenever a buyer
would come by for a home tour, Laura refused to let them in, telling them, <em>“This house isn’t for sale!”</em></p>
<p>Finally, after five months of being stuck in the house together, Jeff got an offer. Laura refused to sign
the deal unless he gave her $40,000 cash. Now, that’s what you call an ugly break-up!
Much like most lessons we learn in life, experience is the best teacher. So I could tell you chapter
and verse every single possible mistake to avoid, and some things simply won’t register until you
actually go through the process yourself. My goal in this section was to give you options and show
you how  you could  save  yourself  time,  money,  and  headaches.  Our  instincts  are  often right,  so
remember my “no-no” advice, listen to your inner voice, and ultimately go with your gut!</p>

  <h2>UNDERSTANDING TITLES</h2>
  
  <p>Essentially, a title company’s sole purpose is to ensure that a property title is clean and legitimate—
that is, that the individual is indeed the rightful owner of both the land and its buildings. Imagine back
in the old days of horses and wagons riding through the prairie, their occupants ready to stake their
claim to any parcel of land they wanted. These homesteaders pitched a sign into the ground with their
name on it and said, “This is my land!”</p>
<p>These days, of course, things are done much differently. Because that land has passed through so
many hands, and so many generations of people have now owned that once “raw” piece of land, we
now have title companies in place to verify the rightful ownership of a given property.</p>
<p>The process starts with a title search, which is performed through a thorough examination of the
records to ensure that the person claiming to own the property is in fact the person who is selling it.
You don’t want to give your hard-earned money to just anyone who says, “This is my house.”</p>
<p>If this sounds ridiculous, believe me, it’s not! Sometimes, through careful and meticulous scouring
through property records, you might find an error. Someone may have died and left their estate to one
or several heirs, and now perhaps one of those heirs is selling it without telling the other relatives. Orperhaps the home was involved in some kind of a legal dispute, such as a divorce or bankruptcy. As
strange as it may seem, this is more common than you realize!</p>
<p>That’s the reason a title company is necessary. The title company will research everything having
to do with the property before the closing, including any outstanding liens, back debts, unpaid taxes,
legally registered owners, and more. The title company also digs deeper to find out if there are any
leases—such as renters who are currently living in the home—and other restrictions or easements that
might affect your ability to take over ownership. These issues must be addressed before the closing.</p>
<p>When a title company finds problems, it can delay the process of closing until the issues are resolved.</p>
<p>In most cases, the title company requests a property survey to clarify the exact boundaries of the
stated plot of land. This is especially important in cases where fences may have been put up that go
“over the line,” or on properties in which the acreage is more than just a specified allotment within a
subdivision. Good fences make good neighbors, right? Well, it would be no fun for you to move into
your new house and suddenly discover that your neighbors own half of your backyard, or that they are
infringing upon your space. This isn’t the best way to begin a relationship with your neighbors. Not to
worry, though, the title company will clear up any such hassles.
</p><p>While we’re on that note, the title company has another important job, and that is to maintain the
escrow. The escrow is the “holding” account for your deposit so that the money is ready to be given
to the seller on the day of closing. It is also common for real estate brokerages or real estate attorneys
to hold checks in escrow for you. You can’t just give a blank check to your real estate broker or your
lawyer; it has to be filled out with the intent that it will be held on your behalf. This is to ensure that
your money is held for safekeeping until the closing.</p>
<p>At closing, the money held in escrow will be distributed to the appropriate parties. Checks will
be cut for the seller, the real estate broker, the attorney, and all of the other parties who are expecting
to get paid. If it’s hard to part with those fees, don’t feel too bad! You are just about to embark upon a
new chapter in your life: homeownership.</p>

  <h2>CHOOSING A TITLE COMPANY</h2>
  <p>To give you greater peace of mind, here are some questions to ask the title company before you
choose who to hire:</p>

<ul>
<li> How long have you been in business?</li>
<li>Are you local, or do you serve other regions, too?</li>
<li> Do you disclose the findings (also known as “exceptions”)?</li>
<li> How do you protect money in escrow, and how safe is it?</li>
<li> Who performs the title research? Is it done individually or by an outside party?</li>
<li> Do you have any conflicts of interest, such as a contractor or mortgage company that alsoowns a title agency?</li>
<li> What are your rates?</li>
<li> How long does the title search and delivery processes take, as well as any other surveys that might be part of it?</li>
</ul>

<div class="flex-rectangle"><h2>CHILL PILL #21</h2>
<p>If you pay for title insurance, you have the right to select the company. Be wary if the seller is
pushing his title company. A title search is meant to find errors before you buy. Use the same
company that your seller did years earlier, and odds are you’ll get the same results. A fresh set
of eyes could unearth problems, allowing you to fix them before you buy.</p></div>

  <h2>WHY TITLE INSURANCE IS NECESSARY</h2>
  
  <p>Title insurance is another aspect of your homebuying experience. What is title insurance for, exactly?
It’s not just another way to get you to spend your hard-earned dollars; title insurance protects the bank
and the owner of the house against any lawsuits that might occur due to title discrepancies or disputes.</p>
<p>There are two different kinds of title insurance. One is the owner’s title insurance, which keeps
the owner out of hot water in case any problems are found during the discovery process. The second
is lender’s title insurance, which protects the lender. Your mortgage company wants to ensure their
money is in good hands.</p>
<p>More than likely, your home will be your biggest investment, and title insurance protects your
interest  in  that  investment.  Title  insurance  protects  real  estate  owners  and  lenders  against  any
property loss or damage they might experience because of liens, encumbrances, or defects in the title
to  the  property.  Without  title  insurance,  you may not  be  fully protected  against  errors  in public
records. As a result, you may be held fully accountable for any prior claims brought against your new
property. If this should occur, your title policy insures that you will be defended at no cost against all
covered claims up to the amount of the policy.</p>
<p>Each title insurance policy is subject to specific terms, conditions, and exclusions. Title insurance
is different from other types of insurance in that it protects you, the insured, from a loss that may occur
from matters or faults from the past. Other types of insurance, such as auto, life, or health, cover you
against losses that may occur in the future. Title insurance does not protect you against future faults,
but it does protect you from undiscovered interests. Another difference is that you pay a one-time
premium for a policy that remains effective until the property is sold to a new owner.</p>
<p>Title insurance is issued after a careful examination of the public records. But even the most
thorough search cannot absolutely ensure that no title faults are present, despite the knowledge and
experience of professional title examiners. In addition to matters shown by public records, other title
problems may exist that cannot be disclosed in a search. Title insurance eliminates any risks and
losses caused by faults in title from an event that occurred before you owned the property.</p>
<p>Real estate brokers (at least the best ones) will often try to refer the best title companies they
prefer. However, the selection is ultimately the decision of the homebuyer, and the responsibility liescompletely on their shoulders. This holds true for title insurance, as well. You don’t have to stick to
the names given if you want to do some additional shopping around for better rates. It’s totally up to
you.</p>

      <h3> #2: WHAT COULD HAPPEN IF YOU SKIP TITLE INSURANCE?</h3>
      <p>WHAT COULD HAPPEN IF YOU SKIP TITLE INSURANCE?</p>
      <p>There have been criminal cases where a seller has knowingly tried to sell a home he or she doesn’t
own. Or instances of renters posing as sellers. But more often than not, problems with titles happen
because a seller simply does not know any better. The seller might have co-purchased the house ten
years ago with a girlfriend or boyfriend they haven’t talked to in years and are unaware that they need
the other person’s signature to sell. Or the seller might have inherited the house under the terms of a
will that turned out to have been out-of-date and a more recent will leaves the house to someone else.</p>
<p>These things happen all the time!</p>
I<p> remember a story involving a newly divorced mother who had just landed her first job in eight
years after being a stay-at-home mom. She decided to buy her first home on her own in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Money was limited, so she decided to cut a few corners. She learned that the title company was going
to conduct a full search of the bankruptcy courts, and land and court records so she figured she could
save a few hundred dollars by not buying a title insurance policy.</p>
<p>At the closing table, the single mother met the seller, a nice, older gentleman named Mr. J, who
had lived in the house for fifteen years. About three months after the settlement, the mother’s eldest
son answered the front door. He was greeted by a woman who asked, “Who are you, and why are you
in my house?” The woman produced her driver’s license, which identified her as Mrs. J. The home
address of the property was listed below her name.</p>
<p>Apparently Mr. & Mrs. J had purchased and lived in the home together up until their divorce. She
had kept her last name and relocated to Philadelphia to live with her sister. Upon divorcing, they
agreed that Mr. J would stay in the home and cover all expenses attached to the home while living
there. But in the event the home was to be sold, both parties were to have split the proceeds. Nothing
was  ever  recorded  in  the  Recorder  of  Deeds  Office  in  New  Jersey,  and  because  the  divorce
proceedings happened in Philadelphia, nothing showed up when the title company searched the New
Jersey court records.</p>
<p>Research revealed that Mr. J had forged the ex-wife’s signature on the listing agreement, and the
power of attorney. To make matters worse, Mrs. J and the single mother learned that Mr. J had the net
sales proceeds wired to an offshore bank account and had apparently moved out of the country and
vanished.</p>
<p>So where does this leave the single mother? Well, it wasn’t pretty. A forged deed cannot convey a
clear title to the purchaser. So when Mr. J signed the deed, he only signed over his fifty percent
interest. Consequently, the single mom did not have clear title to one hundred percent of the home.
Mrs.  J,  never  having signed  the  deed,  still  owned  her  half of the  home.  Had  the  single  mother
purchased owner’s title insurance, she could have simply filed a title claim, and the title insurance
company would have hired attorneys, at their expense, to sort out the mess.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
      <h3> #3: HOW MUCH WILL TITLE INSURANCE COST?</h3>
      <p>HOW MUCH WILL TITLE INSURANCE COST?</p>
      <p>Homebuyers don’t tend to pay much attention to the title insurance required by their mortgage lender,
that is, until they see the charge on their list of closing costs. Title insurance rates vary considerably
state to state and can run anywhere from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand. The insurance
commission approves and controls the premiums for title insurance policies. Premiums are paid only
once, and the cost depends upon the purchase price of the property. The policy amount must be equal
to the purchase price. But considering all the coverage noted above, it’s a bargain in the end.</p>
<p>If  you  examine  the  cost  of  title  insurance  over  the  life  of  the  policy  versus  other  types  of
insurance,  you’ll  find  that it’s  a  great value  for  the  money spent.  It has  been estimated  that if a
homeowner were to pay the national average cost of a title insurance policy and live in their home for
just five years, the annual average cost of the title insurance policy would be less than $200 a year.</p>
<p>Compare that with the annual cost of a homeowners policy, which can range from $500 to $2,500 per
year, depending on the replacement cost of a home.</p>
<p>Many homebuyers rely on their mortgage broker or real estate agent to select a title agent. But take
it from me, you are better off making the selection yourself. I recommend asking your real estate
lawyer to recommend an independent title company, and to avoid title agencies that have a business
affiliation with any real estate agency or lender recommending them.</p>

  <h2>THE LOWDOWN ON HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE</h2>
  
  <p>One of the itemized expenses you may see on your closing documents is a line item for homeowners
insurance.  Each  state  does  things  a  little  differently.  In  some  states  you  are  expected  to  buy
homeowners insurance independently and then provide your attorney and the mortgage company with
an annual  record  of  payment.  In other  states  you are  expected  to  pay your  annual  homeowners
insurance at the closing table. Then your mortgage company will bill you for it and make the payments
on your behalf.</p>

<p>This is similar to when you purchase a car and have a car loan; the bank requires that you carry
full coverage automobile insurance as long as you still have a lien on the car. Even past that point,
most states now require car insurance for every registered vehicle. In the same way, you must have
proof of homeowners insurance in place when you obtain a mortgage from any lender or else they
will not secure the loan. If you buy your house outright, this is not mandatory, but anyone with a sound
mind who cares about their property will of course want to have it insured!</p>

<div class="flex-rectangle"><h2>CHILL PILL #22</h2>
<p>When it comes to choosing homeowners insurance policies, always shop around for the best
coverage, not the best price. This is one area in which being cheap or cutting corners will not
yield any rewards.</p></div>

<p>Be  smart,  though,  and  do  some  price-comparison  shopping.  Not  just  any  old  homeowners
insurance  will  do,  no  sir-ee.  The  cheap  ones  usually cover  only basic  things,  and  often put you
through a lot of red tape when you need to file a claim to get reimbursed for loss or damages. Don’t
forget  my  story  about  “Mr.  Know-It-All,”  the  client  who  went  against  my  advice  on  the  home
inspection and then ended up with about $20,000 of repair costs. Although he did have homeowners
insurance, if you were in a similar situation and had barely any coverage, then most likely there
would be higher deductibles and out-of-pocket costs.</p>
<p>Much like car insurance, which is required before you can even drive a vehicle off the sales lot, a
home must be insured with at least enough liability and hazard coverage to cover replacement costs
for  the  property.  If,  God  forbid,  the  home  burns  down  and  it  is  under-insured  or  even  worse,
uninsured, your mortgage company can and most likely will come after to you to pay back the loan—
even though you no longer have a house to live in.</p>
<p>To get the best coverage and price, you should get at least three quotes. There are a couple of
ways to go about this. If you go online, you will likely find thousands of choices within your state and
region. Call and speak with a live person or visit three well-established and reputable insurance
companies in person. If you like your car insurance provider and have a good rapport, ask if they
offer homeowners insurance. They may even offer a discount for opening an additional policy. You
could  also  ask  the  lender  that  you  plan  on  using  whom  they  like  working  with  or  find  most
dependable. Your realtor might also have some advice, since he or she is most likely well-connected
to other professionals in the industry.</p>

<p>After you decide which type of coverage you need, you can try to get the insurance company to
agree to a lower  rate. This  is  another  area that is  negotiable, since there are so many consumer
options available to savvy homebuyers. Make sure you add on hazard insurance if you live in areas
that are susceptible to catastrophic weather conditions, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, or flooding.</p>

  <h2>HOW YOUR CREDIT SCORE AFFECTS YOUR HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE RATE</h2>
  
  <p>Although we spoke in greater detail about your credit score in Chapter 6, while we’re on the topic of
homeowners insurance, it seems worth another mention. Did you know that your credit score has animpact  on  the  price  you  will  pay  for  homeowners  insurance?  Even  though  having  homeowners
insurance is mandatory for any real estate purchase these days, the price can be greater or lesser
depending on your  credit score.  Although this  sounds  unfair,  insurance  companies  use  a  similar
mindset to mortgage lenders in that they want to protect their investment. Studies have revealed that
people with lower credit scores are riskier customers than people who have higher scores.</p>
<p>You see, homeowners insurance companies are in the business of risk. They try to estimate how
many claims their customers will file each year. Typically, those who are less financially responsible
or  who have  lower  scores  are  more  likely to file  a  claim.  Individual  insurance  companies  have
created their own rating numbers for customers based on their credit scores. Those with high scores
are offered better rates; whereas, those with lower scores can expect to pay more.</p>
<p>So the million-dollar question is, what can you do to get better rates? Start by asking the insurance
company what kind of scoring system they use. Then, ask if you qualify for the best rates and terms. If
not, find out what you can do to qualify for them. Typically, anything that improves your credit score
will also improve your insurance costs. You can also score discounts for having a home security
system,  paying the  entire  premium up  front,  paying by automatic  billing,  or  purchasing your  car
insurance and homeowners insurance from the same company. Shopping around can ensure that you
find the best available price, no matter what your credit score.</p>

<div class="flex-rectangle"><h2>CHILL PILL #23</h2>
<p>Get every discount available to you when you choose home insurance. You may be able to pay
a lower premium because you also have car insurance with the same carrier or because the
home you are purchasing has a security system already installed. However, don’t sacrifice
obtaining the maximum coverage that fits within your budget, because accepting lower
coverage could leave you having to pay out-of-pocket expenses in the event of a claim for
damage or loss. With so many options available to homebuyers, insurance companies are in a
position to negotiate. Some people just settle for the price they are quoted without realizing
they could have “haggled” on price! Every bit you can save on your monthly mortgage payment
adds up to bigger savings at the end of the year.</p></div>

  <h2>DON’T PMS ABOUT PMI: UNDERSTANDING PRIVATE MORTGAGE INSURANCE</h2>
  
  <p>Let’s move onto the other line items you may find itemized on your closing statement, such as private
mortgage insurance, or PMI. To recap once more, PMI is an insurance policy that lenders require
buyers to purchase if their down payment is less than 20 percent. PMI covers the lender, not the
homeowner,  for  up  to  20  percent  of  the  home  price  if  the  homeowner  defaults  and  goes  into
foreclosure. Buyers are required to pay for this insurance until the loan-to-value ratio reaches 80
percent.</p>
<p>So for instance, if you are purchasing a home for $200,000, and it appraises for that exact amount,
you would have to hand over a down payment of no less than $40,000 (20 percent cash equity) and
take a mortgage of no more than $160,000 to avoid being required to pay PMI.</p>
<p>Before considering this to be an ideal alternative to saving up for a large down payment, keep in
mind that PMI premiums can be costly. They may run between half a percent to one percent of the
mortgage total amount each year. That can translate to several thousands of dollars per year. Insurance
premiums are an extra cost and are not applied to the mortgage balance.</p>
<p>When you are considering your budget and how much your mortgage payment will be, be aware of
these extra fees that can add up on top of your monthly payment and cause unforeseen setbacks. The
object here is to enjoy life in your new home, not to be scraping by financially.</p>

        <h3>Amortization</h3>
        <p>A loan repayment includes a portion of the loan that will be applied to pay the interest accrued on the
loan, with the remainder to be applied on the loan’s principal. Over time, the interest payment
decreases in conjunction with the loan balance. The principal amount also increases (amortizes) to
pay off the loan within the designated period of time.</p>

     <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
        <h3>Amortization Schedule</h3>
        <p>A chart that indicates how much of a percentage or amount of each payment will be applied toward

        <h3>Annual Percentage Rate (APR)</h3>
        <p>APR is a value that adheres to a government formula designed to reflect the actual yearly cost of
borrowing. It is expressed as a percentage and typically can be figured by deducting the closing costs
of the loan, then taking the loan payment and factoring the interest rate to figure out the annual
percentage rate. The APR is higher than your your mortgage rate because you will make the same
payment on a smaller amount. This does not reflect the true rate of your loan and is merely a
guideline.</p>

      <h3>Closing</h3>
      <p>Depending on which state you live in, the “closing” is the date in which a real estate transaction is

      <p>Closing costs are separated into two categories. “Nonrecurring closing costs” are any items paid one
time as a result of buying the property or per the terms of the loan. “Prepaids” are any items that recur
over time, such as property taxes, HOA dues, or homeowners insurance.
The lender will make an estimate of the non-recurring closing costs and prepaid items on what is

      <p>The legal document conveying title ownership to a property.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
      <h3>Deed-in-Lieu</h3>
      <p>Short for “deed in lieu of foreclosure,” this transfers the title to the lender if the borrower defaults on
the loan and wants to avoid foreclosure. If the borrower asks for a deed-in-lieu, the lender may
choose to cease the foreclosure process. Regardless of whether the lender accepts the offer, the non-
repayment or avoidance of debt will most likely remain on the person’s credit history. However, a
deed-in-lieu may stall or halt the preparation of documents before a foreclosure enters the public
record.</p>

      <h3>Escrow Account</h3>
      <p>Even after the purchase of a property, you may have an escrow account set up with the lender, which
covers things like property taxes and insurance. You pay extra each month above what is required of
the loan obligation, but the extra funds are held in an escrow account and only released when the time
comes for these items to be paid. The lender then makes the payments on your behalf to save you
stress of saving up to pay these annual bills.</p>

full payment was made before the loan’s deadline.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
      <h3>Prepayment Penalty</h3>
      <p>Some loans are written with a clause that if a borrower pays the loan off early, then they will be required to pay a “fee” or a penalty for doing so.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
      <h3>Prequalification</h3>

      <h3>Property Taxes</h3>
      <p>A government levy on property that each property owner is required to pay. Property taxes are levied

same property, depending on its location.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
      <h3>Public Auction</h3>
      <p>A publicly announced meeting at a courthouse or public location with the intent to sell a property for

      <h3>Short Sale</h3>
      <p>The sale of a real estate property in which the proceeds fall short of the actual balance of debt on the
property, usually because the property owner cannot afford to repay the debt per the terms of the
contract. Therefore, the lender agrees to release the obligations on the real estate by accepting less than what is owed. This is often a better solution than foreclosure, since the lender gets back part of
its investment and the borrower has a less negative mark against his or her credit history.</p>
